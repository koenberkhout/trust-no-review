644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883c8b;R1P5NST8W6O4OQ;;2023-03-31;TRUE;B0014C2NBC;5.0;I kinda hate that I‚Äôm writing this review right now.. ever since crocs came out I thought they were the ugliest thing, vowed never to wear them & made fun of those who did‚Ä¶. Now I‚Äôm a total crocs convert. To be fair a few years ago I had crocs sandals which didn‚Äôt look like crocs & they were super comfy but the bottoms wore out quickly probably due to hot Florida black top then they became slippery on certain floors so I stopped wearing them. I‚Äôm a big cloud sandal lover nowadays but my backyard is all small rock and they kept getting stuck in the holes in the sole & hard to get out. Somehow crocs popped up & the pricing is pretty great on Amazon so I decided what the heck I‚Äôm only wearing them in my own home! Fast forward a literal week I have 2 pairs (indoor & outdoor) & just ordered a new style of sandals ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They are so comfy!!! I‚Äôm a former ballerina & collegiate dancer & have always dealt with on going feet/ankle issues including plantar fasciitis. These make my feet feel wonderful! The lil bumps are like a mini walking foot massage & my arches feel decently supported. I also love how breathable they are & that they clean easily. I usually wear tevas for outdoor & boating/water activities but I think I‚Äôll be wearing my outdoor pair for those from now on in ‚Äúsport mode‚Äù (strap behind heel) lol. I will say their sizing chart is super off when it comes to inch measurements. I normally wear a 6.5/7 but did order my previous croc flip flops in an 8 & those fit perfect. Furthermore, according to the heel to toe inch measurements on here I also should order an 8 so I did‚Ä¶ they work & if you like your shoes more roomy then I‚Äôd say size up but my other marbled pair I got in a 7 & the support feels much better with the more accurate fit to my foot so these larger ones are my inside slippers.;Crocs convert!;real;real;B0014C2NBC;1;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clog;509089;4.8;10;2023-04-29 07:56:06.300
644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883c8b;R30O9PCWL2TBQ;;2023-02-20;TRUE;B0014C2NBC;3.0;"I always put a hold on purchasing these because I never liked the way they looked and the price was just too expensive for me. This time around it was different, I did not care about how ugly or funny they looked or how much they cost, but I just wanted some shoes to give me support, make my feet feel less pain and discomfort for standing and for walking. I will share with you my experience with my first and last pair of crocs. I read some of the reviews on amazon about this product; especially those about having pain, aches, and plantar fasciitis. These reviews were so relevant to my life and I was totally convinced to purchase these. When I first saw them and felt them, they truly felt so light, I tried them on and initially they felt great! They fit me as if they were customized for my feet! I couldn't believe that these light, funny looking shoes might just be the solution for my pain on my feet. I wore them that same day I received them for maybe about 2 hours. During my first experience using my crocs, I was so satisfied, my feet were not burning me and aching me as usual and as I stood in the kitchen preparing a meal, I noticed the comfort right away on my feet. My feet just felt so light, these shoes just felt super light and for several times I thought to myself, why did I not get these sooner? Maybe if I purchased them as soon as I felt the plantar fasciitis symptoms on my left foot I would've avoided surgery? So, for that first week after receiving my crocs, I wore them only at home on my carpeted and linoleum floors to do shores, to clean, to cook, or just to relax at home. I did not wear them the whole day though, just momentarily here and there. I was so happy with them until the real test came a week later. A week later after receiving my crocs, I decided to wear these shoes to do my laundry. I thought, I will be okay, so far they have been working good for my feet at home, so I should be okay if I wear them outside. Throughout the time I was at the laundromat; maybe a little over two hours, I noticed my left toe was getting irritated and becoming painful as my toe touched the toe box in the shoe. I also noticed that the support I was looking for my feet from these shoes was no longer the same after 1 hour of been on my feet. My feet began to ache again, from time time had to limp, and the burning sensation began again. Exactly, I want to say, these crocs felt comfortable on my feet for about 1 hour while standing and moving as I did my laundry. After that I could not stand them, and I just wanted to go home and take them off. After the experience at the laundromat, I wanted to give my crocs the benefit of the doubt and decided to wear them again, but this time to the grocery store. I experience the same as at the laundromat; the crocs only gave my feet comfort for a limited amount of time. My toe was very irritated and in pain due to the toe box on the shoe being too low for my left toe. In conclusion, if you suffer from plantar fasciitis or any type of pain in your feet, these might not be for you. And hey , who knows, they might just be the ones; since we all react to pain and discomforts differently. I think these shoes are perfectly fine if you do not have any feet medical issues; for sure they will make your feet less achy and tired for a long period of time throughout the day. I really mean it, because that's how I felt when I initially began to wear these. But as time progressed, I realized these crocs are only useful for a small period of time and not for me to wear them the whole day. Also, if your toes are curled up, they may touch the tight toe box of the shoe and cause pain and irritation. All in all, I do not regret purchasing these and I know they would've been better on my feet if I did not have the medical issues I have. I hope my story helps you make a decision on purchasing the crocs. I will keep using my crocs but only small period amount of times per week and only at home. Note: It is better to wear them with socks to avoid feet from sweating and your crocs to smell bad later on. The designed protruding lines inside the shoe might make your feet itchy at first like it happened to me. When I wear these with socks they are more comfortable, otherwise the protruding lines inside the shoes bother me a little bit and my feet can get sweaty; I do not like that.";Very light shoes but uncomfortable for my toes;real;real;B0014C2NBC;1;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clog;509089;4.8;10;2023-04-29 07:56:06.300

This one luckily arrived in perfect condition no issues with sizing. However, I ordered two other pairs from different sellers and they were too small, all in the same size. I‚Äôve noticed that the place that are made in is a great factor to size. If they are made in Mexico, they kind of run big but in a good way. They are the most comfortable. Made in Vietnam is okay in sizing, sometimes a little off but overall the shoes usually come in the perfect size. Made in China is always too small for me! I remember ordering some pink ones a year ago made in china, and they were smaller than the other ones. Not sure if this is true for others or only me, just something I have observed! I‚Äôve learned to just shop for crocs in person and avoid the hassle of constantly returning these because the sizing is always weird.;Sizing issues;real;real;B0014C2NBC;1;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clog;509089;4.8;10;2023-04-29 07:56:06.300

I needed something I could wear when out in the yard that was comfy and a little more substantial than flip-flops and not as hot and suffocating as tennis shoes. These Crocs met my needs on both, they go on and can be taken off with ease when going in and out of the house. Comfortable, practical, easy to clean and lightweight. I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised. Now, are they something I will wear out in public? Probably not... For sure they are now my go to yard and around the house shoes. As for pricing, they can be somewhat moderately priced, depending on the style and color you choose. I have seen other styles and colors that are not so moderately priced and not sure if I would spend an impractical amount of money on those Crocs. This particular color and style were perfect for me and my need, and reasonably priced to boot. Will I be a total Croc convert....eh, time will tell.

I bought these to have shoes to slip on so I could go outside and play ball with my dog in the backyard in the mornings during the spring/summer/fall. I had no idea how lightweight they are. They fit good - slightly roomy on the sides, and my toe does go all the way to the front, but I love everything else about them so am not too bothered by the fit. They are perfect for what I need them for - doing some light gardening when it is dewy outside, playing ball with the dog. I love that they have the back/heel strap - that way they don't fly off when I kick the ball.;Great lightweight clog;real;real;B0014C2NBC;1;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clog;509089;4.8;10;2023-04-29 07:56:06.300

I got crocs at the recommendation of a co worker. For reference I work 12 hour shifts in an older hospital unit with very hard floors been wearing them for months and it helps so much with my pain I have neuropathy in my lower legs and feet plus osteoarthritis and meniscus degeneration in my knee. I did opt to get the fur lined ones for work because my feet get really cold and it aggravates my neuropathy.

I‚Äôve never bought crocs online so I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt fit when I‚Äôm buying the same size I always wear (women‚Äôs 10). I‚Äôm too lazy to go to the store to buy them too because sometimes they don‚Äôt have the colors I want. Anyways, I read online where you can use heat to expand or simply make the material soft enough to fix it to your liking. I used a hair dryer on ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and then shoved a glass cup that was a little bigger than the size appropriate for the shoe and waited until it cooled down so like 5-10mins. And IT FITS! It fits better I should say. Before the hair dryer trick, my feet did go all the way in but it was tight and started to hurt on the sides. I just fixed it thank goodness. That hump thing you see because of the glass isn‚Äôt permanent and should go away once you remove the glass cup and wear the crocs for a bit so it can mold around your feet. 4/5 stars because when I buy them in person, the shoe fits but online it runs narrow.;Not for wide feet but there‚Äôs a trick!;real;real;B0014C2NBC;1;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clog;509089;4.8;10;2023-04-29 07:56:06.300

I forgot how much grip a new pair of crocs has, if you intend to use crocs for boating of any kind, new tread makes a world of difference. This pair of crocs is nearly identical to crocs Ive owned in the past, if it isn't broken don't fix it right? If you are looking for a comfortable shoe that can be easily slipped on look no further than the classic crocs. Pros -Very comfortable even for people with wide feet -great grip while new, tread wears over time and they lose grip -buoyant, great for boating or watersports, it floats if you lose it -While the tread on the bottom goes the fastest, the rest of the clog can last, Ive had pairs for years without damage -easy to slip on in a hurry Cons -despite coming in many colors and styles crocs aren't renowned as sexy shoes, with these you are choosing comfort and practicality over fashion -the tread on the bottom does wear out depending on use, with almost daily use I wore the tread out in around a year, i still keep my old pairs for wear around the house TLDR: Very comfortable and practical shoe, slips on easy and is secure enough to move freely without slipping.

644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883c8b;R1YVM98C9RVM4O;;2023-04-01;TRUE;B0014C2NBC;4.0;"So, Crocs are still ugly. But I had to have an alternative to what I was wearing. I can't say anything about the long term of the quality, probably terrible like everything else we humans make because quantity matters over quality. Anyways. Size wise it's just fine. Easier for me to slip in and out with the back ""strap"" down. Although I usually leave it up to make things easier. And my feet aren't all sweaty like they would probably be if I tried wearing real shoes again, which I can't. I haven't tripped yet but that test won't really be accurate until I've worn them down a bit. Just one thing......WHY? WHY are there spikes/stubs on the INSIDE of Crocs? Half the nerves of my feet have been dead since birth so my feet don't always feel as much pain as the average person would normally. Found that out the hard way in high school. So to me it was just uncomfortable at the beginning and my feet are now as used to it as they ever will be but I can't imagine they don't hurt for the average person. Although with Crocs being out as long as they have been I guess it hasn't been as big of an issue as I thought it would be if they are still making them like this....... In summary. if it wasn't for those spikes/stubs it would of received a 5/5 rather than a 4/5.

In fact, they're still holding up great. I just decided I wanted to order more recently, so I found my old order in my history screen and followed the product link here. I thought for sure that I'd be getting the same quality and style as before. Unfortunately, they are not the same. The material is much thinner, the shirt is really baggy and runs long. I ordered large tees the first time around, and they hung down almost to my knees. They do allow for a lot of extra torso room, which can be great, but I felt like I was wearing a tent. I decided to order some mediums as a comparison. They are still long, but even after washing, they have a little room to move around the mid section. I'm keeping both the mediums and the larges, as my weight tends to fluctuate. I just wanted to mention that these loose-fit tees do run pretty large, and they are also quite long. It's still a decent shirt, and I'll probably keep buying them, but hopefully the old style will return at some point.;Not quite the quality and thickness as older styles - Run Long/Tall;real;real;B0000ANHT7;2;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Carhartt Men's Loose Fit Heavyweight Short-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt;107289;4.6;10;2023-04-29 07:58:08.633

I must say, I was surprised by the quality for the price. The shirts are heavy, durable, and fit how you'd expect. Moreover, the neckline is comfortable without being too tight or too lose (a problem I had with a lot of other brands). Though I wish they had a version without the pocket on the front since I primarily wear these as undershirts, I will say they're comfortable and can be worn with pretty much anything. For the price? Yeah, I'll definitely be buying again and start to replace all my undershirts bit by bit.

Given the length of my trip my goal was to pack 14 days worth of shirts, shorts, and undergarments so I'd only have to worry about getting laundry done once. I've never used vacuum bags before, but I knew what to expect. To pack I rolled up my clothes first and then placed them in the bags. Using this method I was able to get 7 polo style shirts in each of the small sized bags, 7 pairs of golf style shorts in each of the smaller bags, and I used 1 medium sized bags for undergarments (which I only used half of) since I was out of smaller bags. I then vacuumed the bags to remove the air using the included vacuum suction tool that came. I vacuumed the bags tot he max so when they were done they were hard as a rock which was a surprise. I then was able to put 2 of the bags in one of my slightly smaller luggage and the other 3 bags in my other luggage. I also was able to easy store the vacuum tool in my luggage side pocket. In all I do like the bags and they work well. I did manage to tear one of the smaller bags as I was packing to return home. Since I'd brought the one medium bag which was only half full I was able to put the stuff from the torn bag in it. A few tidbits. -Initially when I packed I accidentally used one of the rollup bags. I don't care for them at all as they are far inferior to the vacuum sealed ones. -You should always go for the type of bag you plan to fill completely. When I used the medium bag and it wasn't full when you suck the air out you can get into a situation where if all your stuff is on one side the bag will flatten around the hole where the plastic on both sides touch and no more air from farther away gets sucked out.

A few things to know, the travel bags do not compress. They're basically like giant reusable zip locks. Maybe useful if that's something you've used in the past. One of my bags had an issue with the plug coming out and releasing the air, but it's fixable. I'll be curious to see if any of the bags lose their seal in time. I was able to compress everything with the pump included, no vacuum necessary. It works surprisingly well. In the pics, I was able to take that pile of clothes, which had been stuffed in 2 of those blue storage bags and compress them into 1 (2 jumbo bags, and 5 large). Overall, it was the most useful for bulky items like winter coats. There was a noticeable and convenient difference in space.

That's when I discovered the 20 Pack Vacuum Storage Bags. I was able to store my winter comforters and heavier blankets, as well as out-of-season clothing, all while freeing up valuable closet space. Pros: Comes in a variety of sizes (4 jumbo, 4 large, 4 medium, 4 small, and 4 roll) Includes a hand pump for easy compression Protects items from dust, mildew, and odors Reusable and durable Saves space up to 80% Cons: Can be difficult to seal properly Requires manual pumping for compression May not work well with bulky items Compared to other vacuum storage bags in the market, the 20 Pack Vacuum Storage Bags provides a larger quantity and a wider range of sizes at an affordable price.

The little included pump works just fine, but hubby and I took the easy route and just used our vacuum for a quicker seal. My only complaint would be that the opening is the not the exact width of the bag, which caused a little frustration getting our XL items stashed.

I got this for a trip to pack all of my belongings in a relatively small suitcase and I really only needed to use 1 roll up, 1 small, and 1 medium. There were a few comments that were complaining that they were sent a set of bags without the suction valve, but I guess they failed to realize that they were roll-up compression bags? I don't know. The roll up bags work pretty well although they do require a big of pressure. When I first started rolling them nothing was happening but you have to apply consistent and pretty firm pressure and then you start hearing the air release at the bottom of the bag. If I am being picky, I don't like how the bags turn really crumpled once you actually open them after they've been compressed but it's really not a big deal. The hand pump works fine...it just takes a really long time. In the absence of a vacuum cleaner, I would recommend manually squeezing as much air out as possible first and then completely sealing the bag AND THEN using the hand pump. Also if you are trying to use a medium sized bag in a smaller container, once you put the clothes/items inside, fold it in half and then vacuum so that it conforms to a smaller shape. I will try to update this after my trip.;Works really well!

These shirts were inexpensive, so my expectations are possibly unreasonable in this price range. To be honest, they were a bit thinner than I expected. Not overly thin, but somewhere between medium and thin. I don't expect them to last as long as the other shirts I purchased. They are starting to lose their shape after a couple of months of use, while the others from about a year and a half ago are still generally going strong. I'm not a fan of the black text tagless design. Mostly because it is difficult to find black text on a dark-colored shirt. In theory, the front should be how I folded it, and a search unnecessary.

I have worn the ones that are sort of like bike shorts but with more tummy coverage a few times for certain events or outfits and they always pinched and would ride down at the waist, but the shorts would also somehow ride up, I was always super sweaty in them and uncomfortable, they would pinch - it was just an all around bad time. So several years ago, I threw in the towel and just decided I would not deal with it anymore lol. I would wear regular bike shorts under dresses or skirts and otherwise it would be fine. And then I got invited to a fancier event for NYE. And I had a dress to wear already in my closet. But it *needed* shapewear to look how I wanted it to. I went on an Amazon hunt and after many hours of searching and reading reviews - I landed on this one. I got the full body shaper that basically looks like a leotard with shorts lol. I sort of snickered at the idea that I could wear this without a bra - I am a DDD, I didn't even try it without a bra on NYE, just pulled this on right over the bra I was wearing - which worked no problem. The wonderful thing about this shaper is that it actually works how it should. It doesn't ride up or down, it doesn't bunch, it is breathable enough that I don't feel like I am dying - and it smooths everything out and provides protection from chub rub. The shorts are short enough for cocktail dresses - and it is easy enough to pull them shorter if need be and adjust the shaper accordingly. I danced the night away, and drank way too much at the after-after party in this shaper lol. And didn't feel uncomfortable once. Now, the fun part - I decided to try wearing this to go out with the girls a few weekends ago with some jeans and a vest that I have always wanted to wear as a shirt - but never felt I could get away with it with my chest. This shaper *actually* worked with my chest. Was it as supportive as a ""proper"" bra with an underwire? No. Was it more supportive than a bralette? Hell yeah - seriously *so* much better than a bralette. No sagging or weird uni-boob! I loved the amount of support it gave me actually. it looked great with jeans and my vest-as-a-shirt also, but I was so jazzed about how genuinely comfortable I was in it which I never would have actually believed was possible for a bodyshaper. Since then, I have worn it at least 3 other times, to work, or to go out with friends. I've worn it to dinner and had a full meal with no issues, I have sat in the office all day in it and not been uncomfortable. And it gives me such a nice level of support without being restrictive at all. I move around a lot lol - and this doesn't impact me at all. I literally have sometimes forgotten I had it on until I went to use the restroom lol. The only *tiny* thing that I haven't 100% loved about it - is that the bust line is a little high (especially if you are tightening the straps to get as much support as you can lol) so the shaper sometimes would peep out the top of my shirt a bit which I would have liked if it was low enough that didn't happen and so I could get some proper cleavage lol.

Positives: totally snatched the waist and slimmed flanks (love handles) and back rolls. I have a short waist (5 foot 1) and 179 lbs so I did order the L/XL and it fit well. Adjustable bra straps held up the garment and kept it in place for 10 hour day. Over all comfort 7/10 for something with this much compression. Negatives: I am short waisted so the thong portion came up my back a bit and sort of rolled at the top of each hip/booty cheek. Had to be adjusted during the day. Bra was not lined so to hide nipples either use a bra insert or wear normal bra under this, it is stretchy enough for either. Crotch was awkward to clip back together in restroom, thong was a tad uncomfortable due to the wideness of the band that goes between butt cheeks. Shoulder straps a bit cheap so they dug in. Over all good price for compression garment compared to higher priced brand names. If you have a mommy tummy and want something to help suck it back in under dresses and slacks try this one.

I read a lot of mixed reviews, many stated how these fell apart by becoming unraveled & torn. I realized by reading the laundering instructions it may be the key to keeping these for the long haul. I fell in love with the first set of 6 so I purchased 2 more sets. The colors & designs are beautiful as you can see from my pictures. I ordered my first set in November & the other 2 sets in December. Not one pair has torn in anyway. These are 95% cotton, 5% elasthanne. There is some softness to them but not real soft. These are thin & I like them that way. These are barely noticeable in anything I wear including a pair of yoga pants. There is little stretch to them, mostly in the elastic seams, as 95% cotton doesn‚Äôt have much stretch to it. For me these are not tight. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù at 160lbs & large fit me perfectly. I‚Äôm totally comfortable wearing them. As far as laundering, as the instructions state: wash in warm water with like colors on the gentle cycle & lay flat to dry. I feel the reviews of ripping is due to the fact they‚Äôre not washed on the gentle cycle & the shrinkage exists due to putting them in the dryer. I have no clothes I wash in warm so I took a chance & washed them in cold water. No change occurred. The coloring was still vibrant & there was no shrinkage out of the washer. I do wash these on the gentle cycle as I do with the majority of my clothes. I do not put these in the dryer. I let them dry on my hanging rack. 18 pairs 4-5 months later & they are as if they are brand new with no wear or tear. These are my favorite underwear. I prefer them over higher priced underwear I have in my drawer. At $12.72 for 6 pairs that‚Äôs $2.12 a pair, an amazing price for quality underwear. By following the laundering instructions I‚Äôve kept these in tip top shape. I suggest you give these a shot with a heads up on washing with no dry.

However, when I wore my first pair I did like them, because they were thin and did not show through my clothing, and did not ride up on me. I'm glad I went with my gut instinct and did not go by some of the reviewers and I ordered a large, because they do run small. I am 5'5 and 154 lb and a good size booty, but not crazy size one. Other reviewers were saying medium. I usually wear around a medium. Actually, I could have went with an extra large in these, but the large will do this time. If I decide to order another set I will go with an extra large, especially if they don't launder very well. I will be back to let you know how the results turn out once I launder them.

I should have listened to that voice inside my head that said it didn't seem right. The other ones were 2 sizes up from these.... These are definitely too tight. The whole time I needed the size between the size the black ones were and the size these were. Ugh!!! Why do so many clothing manufacturers have inaccurate size charts?! I see this All. The. Time! So I have to return these and get in the correct size. I hate returning things like underwear because obviously I need them and now I have to wait even longer... because their size chart isn't accurate... sigh. My original review had 5 stars, but I took a star away because of their size chart issue. If it had been correct all along, I would have had the right size the first time. I was right when my inner voice told me not to trust the chart. This review is for the black ones: So, my bad, I ordered a size too large, however, I'm not returning them because they are super comfortable! Next order I went down 2 sizes and I'm waiting on them to arrive. I have a huge problem with wedgies! No matter who made the underwear or if they are bikini or brief or whatever, it happens all.the.time.!!! Not with these, though, and that's why I'm not returning them even tho these are a bit loose... but because they are cotton, I'm hoping they will shrink just a little bit and they'll be fine. I'm putting them in dryer on purpose to shrink hopefully... fingers crossed. I will review the correct size when I get them, but right now I will say I am happy with these.

I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre waterproof since I didn‚Äôt immerse myself in water while I was wearing them. But don‚Äôt wear them if you plan on sweating with them. Or if you go somewhere too hot/humid. They, themselves have good adhesion but we, ourselves, secrete sweat when there‚Äôs sticky silicone applied anywhere on our body for a long period of time. Because of this sweat, it causes these silicone stick ons to slide off. You can buy anything that says it‚Äôs ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù but if it‚Äôs something you apply on your bare skin, your skin WILL eventually sweat under it causing it to slide off or slide around even if you don‚Äôt do any exercise or aren‚Äôt in humid weather. With these though, it doesn‚Äôt happen for a while as long as you don‚Äôt workout in them or like i said, are in humid/hot weather. I‚Äôd make sure I was wearing a tight top though so there‚Äôs a a better chance that they‚Äôd stay on even if I sweat. They‚Äôre easy to wash, I just use soap and water. Be careful with your nails though, you don‚Äôt want to scratch them. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt use any kind of scrubber to wash them because if the inside gets scratched, it makes it even harder to thoroughly wash it next time because your sweat/bodily oils will embed even deeper in them. Also you want them to last as long as possible. If you see a little fuzzy or hair on there don‚Äôt go crazy trying to get it out under the water, you‚Äôll scratch off some material so it‚Äôs not worth it. Just leave it be and wait till it dries. You can try to slide it off while dry but be careful. I‚Äôd recommend keeping the plastic circles they come in to store them in there and in the box after they‚Äôre washed and dried. These are awesome with invisibility under clothes. You also don‚Äôt feel them when you wear them.

It didn't affect my skin, however, and they were still adhered just as well as when I first put them on.

644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883c96;R1QV56X6BEBSXB;;2023-04-17;TRUE;B07DPSM91T;5.0;I purchased the Wendy Grey at Famous Footwear and loved them so much I came to Amazon to order them in black as well. I wear a 7.5 but in shoes like Sanuk and Allbirds which don‚Äôt come in half sizes, I wear an 8. I went with an 8 for these as well. I tried a seven in the store and could tell that they would end up hurting my big toe, especially when my feet swell after being in them for hours. The 8 in this style/material fits me. It‚Äôs a looser fit but not in an oversized way. It does not slip off my heel and there is only about a centimeter of room in front of my big toe so an 8 was the right choice. That said, the material in these two colors is the thinner, more pliable cotton. I tried on other Wendy colors that were the thicker, stiffer canvas and my heel slid out of an 8. I will probably not buy any other material unless they start making half sizes. I also bought the Hey Dude Eloise Bootie (stiff material) from Journeys and had the same issue where the 8 felt better on the front half of my foot but my heel lifted up when I walked, and the 7 fit the back part of my foot but felt more narrow and snug on the front half which may be ok if you have narrow feet but I have an average foot leaning very slightly wide. I did end up keeping the 7 in the bootie to see how much they stretch, but all this is to say, if you are a half size, just know that the thinner cotton material will fit you differently than any of the other fabrics. In addition to the frustration of no half sizes, the company doesn‚Äôt make it clear which colors are the thinner cotton fabric. They list them all under the same Wendy style so you have to look closely at the pictures to see which ones have wrinkling, especially around the tongue to know which is the thinner material. They will also not have a printed lining so that‚Äôs another clue. Yes, I recommend. I wore them for three days in a row to walk around on vacation and never had any pain. Good support, well cushioned for shock absorption, lightweight and breathable, plus super cute for a casual look. They just need to make half sizes and separate by material type.;Very comfy but not half size inclusive;real;real;B07DPSM91T;12;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Hey Dude Women's Wendy Lace-Up Loafers Comfortable & Lightweight Ladies Shoes Multiple Sizes & Colors;109503;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:00:57.330

I was torn between two sandals - one those infamous marshmallow shoes and the other supposed to be a great one with peacock colors. Something wasn't quite right about both. They were good, but not great. I was having an issue with both causing my ankle to roll. I could wear a brace and be fine, but something was holding me back. Then I got these shoes. Sparkly silver to fascinate my inner cat. I put them on and they were perfect. No issues and comfortable. I decided to return the sandals. As much as I liked them, I knew I would never love them. As for this shoe - very light. I loathe wearing enclosed foot shoes. I'm very much a slide person until I can't be. This was the first shoe that didn't cause issues. They were comfortable. Good inner pad. Sparkle was nice without being in your face. Just enough to catch the eye. I wear 9 - 10 depending on the shoe. I got a 10 in these and they are a tiny bit big. That's fine with me. I would rather that than too small. 9.5 would have been great for my foot. I do like that my feet don't get too hot in these. Inside is not scratchy at all.

The reviews are great as far as comfort goes, but being a girly-girl I was skeptical that they would pass my style test. Well, these little shoes are SUPER comfortable. They pass the style test too (grabbed the white crochet looking ones). My only complaint, which I know I‚Äôm not alone, is that they don‚Äôt come in half sizes. I wear an 8.5 (mostly 8.5 wide), but sized down to an 8 and they are just a bit big. I wear no-show socks so it helps, however if they came in half sizes a 7.5 they would have been perfect.

Inserts, exercises. stretching, specialty shoes, staying off my feet entirely and so many other things. All helped to some degree but just as I would make some progress in healing, suddenly the pain would worsen again. I work from home but I‚Äôm still very active and on my feet much of the day. I started just wearing my converse around the house to get some support and noticed a bit of an increase in pain relief that my other PF specific shoes and insoles didn‚Äôt provide. I didn‚Äôt want to wear my everyday outdoor shoes around the house all day though so I intended on grabbing a new pair of converse to wear as house shoes when I came across an article on Hey Dude shoes being more comfy like slippers. So I grabbed a pair not expecting any more support and comfort than my converse. I have been so pleasantly surprised! I‚Äôve been wearing them about a week and have noticed a significant decrease in the pain. I‚Äôm even able to get back into more walking and exercise again wearing them. There‚Äôs not a ton of arch support but definitely more than my other sneakers. My pain seems to stay in my heel and only slightly into my arch and these have been perfect. The minute I put them on it was pure relief. In just a week I‚Äôve noticed my pain had diminished to about half what it was. If you‚Äôve ever had PF then you know just how painful it can be and how long it can take to heal so it‚Äôs impressive to see this much improvement. I‚Äôm still doing my plantars routine of tens machine in the morning, ibuprofen through the day, icing in the afternoon and massage gun at night but these shoes have made the biggest difference for me. They do run big. I‚Äôd say about a size bigger but I also wear thicker socks in the winter so that‚Äôs worked out fine for me. I‚Äôm usually a size 8 and I could have easily gone down to a size 7. I have a more narrow foot and am a plus size woman, if that helps. For now though they are perfect with my socks so I‚Äôll likely just grab a size 7 for the warmer months :) Super comfortable. Possibly the most comfortable shoe I‚Äôve ever worn. Very lightweight too.

She decided to switch schools and is now staying with her dad and so go the yeezys. I checked them out online and prices have doubled. So I found these. They're not as good as yeezys but they're not bad. They're comfortable. I wear an 8 1/2 shoe and I got a 9-10 and fits perfectly.

This covers them COMPLETELY, even my Playtex Comfort Strap Bra straps, which are gynornous (I own 3). The tank tops still look good under shirts. They‚Äôre close fitting enough to not make wrinkly lines. I was worried I would have to wear a t-shirt, which is not as attractive or cool in the heat as a tank. I would not wear these alone because they only go up to size XXL and I‚Äôm a 2X. I got these to fit close enough to wear under shirts. I prefer a loose fitting tank to wear by itself. I would try these if they came in plus sizes (1X, 2X, 3X, etc.). I would probably try a 3X. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 217 lbs., and pear shaped with the round part of the pear starting at my belly and spreading out through the hips and big legs. I like a tank to stop at the high hip for an undershirt so it doesn‚Äôt bunch up in the hips and belly. This fits the bill. For outerwear, a tank that covers my upper thighs and is roomy in the belly (but doesn‚Äôt fall off my shoulders) is a must. 5 stars, for my purposes! Note: I ordered the Coral Pink & White 2-pack, and the Dark Green & Navy. The Coral Pink is darker than shown, more of a bright Coral, not light. It‚Äôs a pretty tank, but if you‚Äôre looking for an exact match this is not it. White is bright white. The Dark Green has a hint of Teal, but the Dark Green & Navy are as pictured. Fortunately, I only bought the Dark Green to match something and it does. I am happy with my purchase. I will definitely be ordering more, as I often need cleavage control.

I ordered a second set a size larger than I normally would because I am tall with a longer torso and I ended up liking that fit also. Now the tank fits a bit looser & it comes down long enough to cover the back of my pants when sitting ( if you get my drift ). I did keep both sizes because I like a fitted fit as much as I like a loose fit. That part all comes down to personal preference.

If I had a dollar for every bag of tortilla chips I consumed during the last six months, I would be able to afford to move back to NYC! And not have to work! The second event was cataract surgery ( and yes-when you get old it‚Äôll happen to you!). Forgetting about the impact this pandemic has in connection on healthcare, I recently had the first of two cataract surgeries. Dopey me. I wore a little black dress thinking I would have to change in a hospital gown. Instead, I had to wear my lbd during surgery! Not wanting to expose my gorgeous panties or worse, a blanket was placed over me. Needless to say my thoughts were ‚ÄúNFW am I wearing a dress to my next surgery‚Äù.

I like my pants to stay snug and not stretch out whether I‚Äôm walking or doing weight training or working out inside. After one mile of walking they‚Äôve already stretched out and are loose and a little baggy in my legs and ride down. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 150lbs and ordered a size medium and fit great the first couple of times I wore them but even after washing them they are beginning to get loose and I‚Äôve only worn them for a week.

My bridesmaid dress sat on the edge of my shoulders and even with alterations and being so tight I could barely move, it still would not stay on my shoulders. In comes this tape. I taped my shoulders and bust all the way around, front to back. Could I move? No. Did my dress move? Also No. This tape did a wonderful job of keeping my dress on me. I would have been miserable without it. I was able to dance and move and do what I needed to - although restricted because tight dress. The tape did pull a bit but it stayed stuck to my skin and the dress. I had to have help being taped in. So if you are going to use this, seek help. I think the value of this is great. You get a ton of strips and get your moneys worth. All the other bridesmaids were coming and getting tape from me. I had plenty for myself, four other bridesmaids who had to be taped in completely and the bride. The only complaint I have with this stuff is it puts your skin thru the wringer. I spot tested this out as I have sensitive skin and it gave me hives where I pulled the tape off. Also you have to be very careful pulling this off as it will rip your skin.

644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883ca2;RXI8LG315TPCC;;2022-08-10;TRUE;B01IXFPJJU;5.0;In my day polos used to be soft thick 100 % cotton with generous sleeves covering the upper arm till above the elbows and collars standing high and grand and covering the back of the neck till below the hairline. They had substantial structure/body (shape that held) and ultra comfortable soft cotton. This was my go to piece of clothing to step out in (as opposed to round neck collarless T-Shirts that I wore only at home or for sporting activities). However, this simple good thing was not to be taken for granted. As time went by, I watched in horror this simple evergreen staple slowly vanish - being replaced by plastic, toxic, carcinogenic trash (synthetic, polyester, 'performance', 'hi-tech') being passed as clothing riding solely on deceptive/misleading/convincing marketing and rapidly transient 'fast fashion trends'. These pieces of junk being passed as 'performance polos'/'hi-tech' had no 'body', clung to your skin like plastic, caused my sensitive skin to itch, with arms so short as if there was shortage of clothing material in the world and were of such thin cheap uncomfortable material that I would wonder how in the world do people put these on their bodies. The 'trend' continued ... Fast forward to the present day, finding the 'cotton polo of my youth' is like finding a dinosaur. The polo I grew up with is practically extinct - replaced by trash made with ever cheaper feeling and more toxic materials. Its a win win for the corporates/brands - cheap synthetic lab created materials astronomically marked up (riding on advertisement) - filling the corporate pockets unlike never before and successfully 're-programming' the minds and purchasing behavior of the new generation to accept, get used to, and even get addicted to such toxic 'hi-tech' trash. As for the manufacturing ? No problem - hire some MBA's (with zero knowledge/passion for good quality textile/garment manufacturing) - their sole purpose to be 'maximizing profits' for the next 'earnings report' and they would find the 'cheapest' offshore factory to outsource the manufacturing to. This being a continuous process - if you get a cheaper bid from another factory, just switch to it. No wonder you can never get consistent material, sizing, quality for the exact same product purchased even months apart. Not just that - even brands that sold fantastic quality 100 % cotton polos at a very reasonable price like Tommy Hilfiger etc went STEEP DOWNHILL. A Tommy Hilfiger polo being sold today is NOWHERE NEAR anything like the quality they had even a few years ago (even though still being theoritically 100 % cotton, the quality (material, cut) now is absolutely junk - in fact they went from being my favorite Polo Shirts (thick, soft, cloud like cotton with generous neck and sleeves and amazing body, texture and shape and in high quality colors and finish) to absolutely shockingly unwearable pieces of garbage (thin, rough, itchy cotton with skimpy sleeves and flat collars and dull cheap finsih and colors with NO lusture, body whatsoever). I always wish I had seen this day come. I would have stocked up on a lifetim's supply of 'real' clothing when they were still available. Given the above, I am extremely surprised (pleasantly) by this Amazon Essentials Cotton Polo. This is 100 % cotton, has generous non-skimpy sleeves and has decent material and shape reminiscent of the 100 % cotton polo I am habituated to from my time. Quality of material wise - it is about 65% - 70% of the cotton polos of yesteryears - BUT - even THAT - is like finding diamond (or a dinosaur) in these abhorrent-clothing-times for the 100 % cotton polo lover.

I am typically either a 34B or 32C. No bra seems to fit me absolutely perfectly. In looking at the dimensions and sizing chart, it seems my best option was to go for a medium size, though I typically wear a small. As we can see in the photos, it is not a perfect fit (these sports bras rarely are for me) and there are some gaps to be considered. The photos were taking from a try-on after opening package, so it‚Äôs a bit wrinkled and not flattering in that way, but that can be remedied by a wash cycle. Onto the gap at the base. On one hand, I consider this a pro, because I deeply dislike that band on certain tops that digs into the skin. When I have a top on, I don‚Äôt want to feel constricted anywhere, otherwise it is extremely uncomfortable. In this case, as seen in photos, it actually curves outward in the back, which is not necessarily flattering, but for my purposes of wearing around the house or running errands with a cardigan, it‚Äôll work. Another pro is the cups and band, which fit comfortably without causing too much compression or pain. Now, if you‚Äôre a 34B/32C like me, and in the market for cleavage and don‚Äôt care about the side flat boob look and mainly care about the front look, going smaller would be your best bet for that. When I am seated, there is an obvious gap in the side boob area, and the shoulder bands lift up a little. Again, not a complete deal breaker, but not an obvious fit. Consensus is that it is a comfortable top for lounging in and providing support if you are going out and don‚Äôt want the nips exposed. If you size up and want it to look better, I recommend a cardigan as it will address all of the issues that I mentioned. If you are using for gym purposes, sizing down may be preferable, for compression sake. Ultimately, it is a great top and I can appreciate the comfort at sizing up provided. I, for one value comfort and quality material over look.

Lulu does have a more secure feeling to the underbra. Stitching is very similar, possibly more defined on the straps. Shape of ""V"" neck was more of a heart shape on the Align Tank and on this tink it's been cut to more of a sharp ""V"" Overall quality and feel: Definitely worth 20$ just get it!";Well worth it !;real;real;B088M5Z6ZR;25;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Women‚Äôs Longline Sports Bra Wirefree Padded Medium Support Yoga Bras Gym Running Workout Tank Tops;31715;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:15:27.098

I am 5‚Äô9 and I am 132 pounds and have a longer torso and it sits right above my belly button. The bra is great quality that is built in but the pads have a bit of a weird indentation around where the nipple should be. I‚Äôve ordered a few of these and not every single one has this weird padding but some do. A size small was too small for me but I medium fit perfect. The small had the weird padding but the medium did not. I have not washed either of these yet, so I‚Äôm not sure if the padding will straighten out or not but I just took the padding cups out and replace them with some other ones that I had and it was perfect.

The fit is as expected and the wirefree underbra is comfortable and supportive. The outer layer (the long tank) is form fitting, too, and unless you are built like a skinny stick, it will roll up the instant you put it on. This might have been prevented by adding a band of grippy rubber dots on the inside bottom of the tank, but imagine how uncomfortable that would be. I decided to keep it and just fold the tank up a couple of inches to prevent it rolling up. Bottom line: Great out-of-the bag option for very straight bodies with no fat.

I bought these Shapermint along with a similar designed pair of Spanx. Hands down, the Spanx are better for me. Shapermint uses a thicker elastic material that sticks to my yoga pants and creates extra creases. They also don't smooth my shape at all. Also, the edge of the fabric at the thighs is double thickness and creates an obvious line In contrast, the Spanx are made of a thin, silky stretch fabric that disappears under all my yoga pants and is seamless where it counts. And they smooth my shape beautifully. While more expensive, I think the Spanx are hands-down a better product.;"Doesn't shape much; leaves visible seams on thighs";real;real;B07YNY69X6;28;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;SHAPERMINT High Waisted Body Shaper Shorts Shapewear for Women Tummy Control Thigh Slimming Technology;7592;3.9;10;2023-04-29 08:15:45.584

I had low expectations for these, tbh, the ad has that ""ultra-cheap"" feel. But I needed to replace a couple other ones that broke, and the price was right :) I'm also particular about color, and there's a ton of choices. These are amazing! Much better quality than I was expecting in every way (comfort, fit, style, material)(so soft!). In my opinion, a steal for the price.

I purchased the XXL long crop in black, grey, and white and, even though there is no padding, the white did not show anything. The top feels so nice against my skin - I even sleep in these. I loved them so much that I purchased three more the day after I received them! I still had some issues with rolling at the bottom but they were minimal compared to sports bras I have tried.

Ok, so with sticky bras it's been a little hit or miss and nipple covers have also been the same way. I got the bra that looks the most like actual skin. Firstly, it came with nipple covers that have the same adhesive. I didn't know it would, but nice surprise (and I've actually worn those more so far). They blend seamlessly on me (34-36 C). The adhesive is honestly admirable, because I really put it through a whole test, by accident. They're so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing them. I wore them all day, from when I woke up to night. My friend stayed over and we went to our apartment gym to exercise because she hasn't seen it yet, at 10 pm after already having sweated in them all day. I got back, still forgot I was wearing them, and went to sleep because at that point I was honestly just too tired to shower. I woke up the next day and realized I was still wearing them when I went into the bathroom to shower. These nipple covers went through a full days wear, a small run/weight lifting and a bit of yoga, and a full night's sleep, and stayed perfectly in place the whole time. Seriously wow. And they only got itchy a little bit during my third time wearing them for like 8 hours and being a little warm so therefore a little sweaty. I do recommend not wearing them for that long, even though you apparently can haha. It is adhesive, so of course not breathable. Sweat/condensation beads build up under them through the day. I personally didn't notice any discomfort from this, but I'm not sure how good that is for the skin. Again, I wore them way longer than any person should, at least the first time, and for things they weren't intended for like exercise üòÇ All I can say is that they're still sticky and I could wear them again a couple times at least if I need to, which I eventually will. The bra I only wore once so far, but it also blended in perfectly with no lines on my clothes. The clip is nice, brings them together with nice lift and shape. Plus you can decide how much cleavage you want. I think I got a B size because other reviews said to size down? It works nice üôÇ This is a bra/pasties combo that lasts through A LOT and is so comfortable. I recommend washing the area you're applying to right before putting on to make it last longer. I forgot to do that the first time and they still worked perfectly though. I also kept the little plastic cup shaped thing that came with it and the little plastic circle things on the pasties so I could stick them to it when not in use and have them last longer that way too.

644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883cac;R3RD0EO8QFXMLF;;2022-05-14;TRUE;B07RSXYKK3;5.0;At first I was skeptical. I have tried so many push up bras, strapless bras, even other weird ‚Äúmagical‚Äù sticky bras. I even tried that metal deep V shape bra that was supposed to work with big breast‚Ä¶. None ever worked. I wasn‚Äôt going to try this one until I saw a woman with breast like mine wearing them. I was still skeptical because her breast looked a tad firmer than mine. I read her comments and she said to size up, so I did. I never realized my breast were bigger than I thought so my boobs popped out the top just a little bit it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable. So I‚Äôm ordering another one right now but a size bigger. If u have smaller, firmer breast go down a size to get them extra pulled together. If you are bigger, have bigger breast, or have ‚Äúolder‚Äù boobs (ü§£ü§£ children ruined mine) you probably want more coverage so again go up a size. Also, I follow the instructions and clean them every time and I place the plastic wrap back on it to keep the longevity. Honestly I‚Äôm a E now I thought I was a DD and I can wear these all day if they were cleaned and stored properly. I chose to wrote the review because today is the first day in my entire adult life that I went outside in a spaghetti strap tank top BRALESS!!!! I felt sexy, I felt hot, men were starring at me again. I always cover up NOT ANYMORE üòÅ My husband said ‚ÄúDamn, those look really good. Go put on another shirt.‚Äù My neighbor asked my name and we have been neighbors for 3 years ü§™üòúüòè listen I‚Äôm happily married but it felt nice to have the confidence to go outside, to have people look at me again, n my husband turn red because he got jealous. Which in a way was good for us, we are together now for 15 years and it was cute to see him get flustered at my body again. I‚Äôm not saying my husband doesn‚Äôt love my body but he never gets to see it because I‚Äôm always hiding it. This bra has been a life changer and I hope my review helps someone else purchase one of these adhesive bra because you will NOT be disappointed at all. Pros: easy to use, adhesive last a long time, they give my girls a lift, I feel confident and sexy, they are extremely comfortable, I feel secure and safe wearing it for hours outside. Con‚Äôs: my boobs underneath get sweaty from being pushed together, sometimes my boobs feel like they poke out on top of the bra if not put on perfectly the first time. My biggest con is that I didn‚Äôt buy this bra sooner!! The video is from the first time I actually wore it out, you can see it took me time to figure out how to place it perfectly on my breast. Which was the hardest part for me but once I found my sweet spot it‚Äôs easy to stick them on and go. They are super comfortable. P.s- if you are having a problem with support it could be because you aren‚Äôt putting it on right. When I first put it on I thought the same thing. I had to go on YouTube and watch some videos. I find it works best at a 45 degree angle with the clasp pointing more downward. Then I have to push and lift my breast to snap it in place then they stay perfectly üòç;Life changing!!

I needed enough coverage that my entire chest area was the same ""shape and size"" so I went with an E so I could get enough side coverage and top coverage where I am flat and create that pretty contour I've always wanted.

I wasn‚Äôt kidding when I said I have these in multiple colors, so when I ordered my third pair, again, tight in the waist and kinda short, but then the 4th pair I ordered it was back to the loser fitting. So the sizes are definitely a little wonky! Especially for them to be ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù sweats. But nonetheless I like them! They are thin and I do have to pull and stretch them when they come out of the dryer but for $10-$12 bucks it‚Äôs worth it. I love having a matching pair of comfy clothes on my lazy days at home!

The Jerzees Men's Fleece Open Bottom Sweatpants which are thicker like these Fruit of the Loom. They too appear to run longer in the leg like the Hanes.

I like heavy weight cotton T- shirts for their durability and wear. I previously bought one of these and was satisfied with it. But I wanted a somewhat heavier shirt, so I did an experiment: I bought two of these and one each of other, lesser known brands. The other shirts cost 2 to 3 times as much. Both had slightly heavier weight cotton. However, after washing all shirts a few times, my conclusion was that these Hanes shirts are far softer and more comfortable than the others. Even though they are a bit lighter weight, my experience is that they wear well. They are by far a better value than the heavier, much more expensive shirts I bought on Amazon.;Best value in heavy t-shirt;real;real;B00NOY3JOS;38;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Hanes Men's Unisex Beefy Crewneck Cotton T-Shirt (1 Pack Or 2 Pack);37726;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:16:51.008

I ended up cutting the sleeves off of a few to turn them into sleeveless undershirts. Overall these shirts have really held up well - they put those thin tshirts to shame...seriously. They are thick but not so thick that they are hot to wear, and the collar is well formed so that your collar will stay shaped well for many months to come. Are my collars a little morphed now? Well yea, of course. Ive been wearing them everyday for almost a year now. But do they last longer than the thinner brand name shirts? You bet! Do these shrink? Nope. I haven't experienced them shrinking at all, maybe they did a little but i have never had that problem with these. Would i recommend these? Absolutely. Are they a little expensive? yea, they cost a little more than average. But honestly we all know that you get what you pay for - that seems to be more and more true for me everyday. If your looking for a cheap throw away shirt with a morphed collar then choose the cheap ones. But if your looking for something that will last and has a good thickness to it, then these are definitely worth a try. And if worst comes to worst and you dont like them, then just return them at a local kohls. Either way, yes i recommend these - they have and continue to serve me very well everyday.

644cb0cdedd6fb90e1883cb5;R3HWHIZ8U0HDKJ;;2018-07-08;TRUE;B07612TNCZ;5.0;"I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked. I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart. Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom. Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt. Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive. Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur. I hope that this review is helpful to you. Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer. Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver. I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out. I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however, I like a looser-fitting T-shirt. I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat. Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them. June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral. September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out. November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them. They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum. November 28, 2020 - I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom. March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors. September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.";Solid value T-shirts;real;real;B07612TNCZ;43;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Gildan mens Ultra Cotton T-shirt, Style G2000, Multipack;87470;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:17:29.771

I thought they looked cheap compared to the other water shoes I have bought in the past. I didn't think they would last at all. In reality, the material is very nice, soft and stretchy, so they are super comfortable. You feel like you have naked feet, but you're wearing these shoes. They lasted too. I wear them on my water days when I have to walk the rows of my vineyard to find where the moles have dug a hole in the ground and are draining the water from my vines. They protect my feet, and they usually stay on when I sink into the mud. To be fair, my boots and my other water shoes can also come off depending on how much suction is in the mud. My rubber boots get sediment in them, which rubs against my ankles or shins leaving a rash, and other water shoes from a sports store had soles that fell off. That could be from the 100 degree temperatures or putting my foot on a shovel to fill in the holes, but still shoes shouldn't lose their soles. I wasn't happy with the price of $12.55, but I was impressed with how well these held up and will be using them again this season.;Surprised that they held up so well on my farm.;real;real;B07496VHQJ;47;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;VIFUUR Water Sports Shoes Barefoot Quick-Dry Aqua Yoga Socks Slip-on for Men Women;126050;4.3;10;2023-04-29 08:18:00.584

They're roomy, so not to push out the toe while exercising, but not so roomy to slip off. The big unexpected win is that wearing them gives more resistance in the water so a better workout!

I normally wear a size 6 1/2 in most shoes so I ordered the women‚Äôs size 5.5-6.5 since I did not want them to be loose at all and other reviewers said they were stretchy. That size fits me perfectly. The is no gapping around the top of the shoe and my toes are not pushing against the front of the shoe. They are lightweight and were comfortable when I walked around in them on carpet. The soles seem thick enough to withstand walking on pavement and sand. I hope when I wear them in the water they protect my feet from small rocks or other sharp things but will not know that until I try it. I plan on taking them on a upcoming cruise to wear when the ship docks at a private island for the day. Hopefully they will comfortable to wear all day. I also hope they are easy to clean sand out of and that they air dry quickly. I will also wear them (if allowed) on a water tube ride that is on the cruise ship and imaging they will work great for this purpose by keeping my feet warmer and giving me traction so I don‚Äôt slip getting on/off the ride. A lot of the reviewers stated that their toes were pushing out of the shoes within a short time wearing them and I hope that was only because they wore them in a lot of rough terrain or they did not have the correct size.

These shorts are not only comfortable and versatile, but they are also durable and stylish. The traditional cargo style is perfect for any occasion, whether I'm going hiking or just running errands. The relaxed fit sits at the natural waist with a relaxed seat and fit through the thighs, making them extremely comfortable to wear all day long. Plus, with a 10-inch inseam, I never have to worry about them being too short or too long. One of my favorite features of these shorts is the quick-access storage they offer. With (6) pockets, including (2) side cargo flap pockets, (2) slash pockets, and (2) back patch pockets, I have ample space to store my personal items and gadgets. This is especially convenient when I'm on-the-go and need to have everything I need at my fingertips. The materials used in these shorts are also incredibly durable. I appreciate that they are offered in a variety of stretch fabrications including twill and rip stop, ensuring they will last for years to come. The heavy-duty hardware, including the zipper fly and button closure, gives me peace of mind that they won't fall apart after just a few wears.

I've had them for a few months and they are holding up very well. Many thanks to the creators of these slippers. One of the best things I've ever bought for myself and my joint health. Update... still love the first pair, but needed another pair. Second pair I ordered arrived and they are too big. Checking to see if a family member can use them. But, may send back and unsure if I should try ordering the same size again (10 1/2 - 11 1/2 women's).;Saving my knees, but 2nd pair too big;real;real;B09652VJP1;52;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Joomra Pillow Slippers for Women and Men Non Slip Quick Drying Shower Slides Bathroom Sandals | Ultra Cushion | Thick Sole;24428;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:18:40.469

But I can easily walk 2+ hours at a moderate pace without pain or fatigue in my feet. I love this flat it's perfect for everyday, office, dressy and travel. From day one I have never gotten a blister on any red spots. Mostly because of the scrunchie design of the shoe. Also I wear no show socks in black but I keep it above the line of the shoe or tights/nylons. And the few times the sock does slip it still hasn't irritated my feet. I don't have a picture but the product picture speak for themselves. I ordered the to suede like fabric in a 8.5W and they feet perfectly although my foot is extra wide, sometimes my pinky toe slides off the sole at times but it's not a bother or noticeable unless you step in water. That is the only reason I know since these flats are not water resistant or proof I would be careful on wet areas or weather heavy days. So far my feet haven't gotten hot/sweaty or to cold but I've never warm them below 45 or above 70 yet. But I don't think I'll have an issue with hot weather. For cold it might be a problem below 30 or 40. I already have plans to buy many more colors and I have my eye on some of the colors out of stock, so hoping they make them again. I do think they are worth way more than the price. But I hope these never get retired or sold out I will love them into old age. I need to mention the longevity, I've had them for a few months and have walked on many surfaces and have never worried about slipping or falling. I just avoid rain and puddles, but they still look brand new even though I have walked on wet grass several times. And I have yet to need to clean them so far.

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883cbf;R207O86USIDT6M;;2023-03-23;TRUE;B07FR5FNTT;4.0;My ideal shoe is one that feels like no shoe at all. I don't care much about cushioned soles or arch support so your mileage might vary with these shoes. I ordered the 10 wide and 10.5 to try as I sometimes struggle to find shoes that are truly wide. The 10 wide fit as expected and were comfortable all day. I walk between 8k to 10k steps a day and had no issues with foot pain or discomfort from these shoes. The rose gold is very on trend and I received several compliments on the color. My only issue with these shoes and the reason I took off a star is that they are not quality. They're great for what they are but after just one day of use, my pair is wearing out. I had some flaking on the heel of the sole and scuff marks that will become holes on the outer side of both shoes.

I wore them at work for a test run. (I am a teacher and I put them on as soon as I got in my classroom) 3 hours later I had to change shoes as my toes hurt.

They don‚Äôt cause any cramping, and they‚Äôre perfect for the office. My go-to flats before now were the $30 ones from Target, but these are cheaper and equally comfortable (for me!). Now for some of the negatives: -My feet are quite wide so they were pretty tight at first, but after wearing them they stretched out nicely -If you enjoy shoes that feel like you‚Äôre stepping on a cloud, these are probably not for you. They don‚Äôt have a whole lot of padding and they can start to irritate the bottom of your heel after a lot of wear in a day -They‚Äôre not very structured which can effect the longevity IF you step more on the outside of your foot, and the side of the shoe can get damaged.

And I wanted something inexpensive that I wouldn't be worried would possibly get destroyed wearing or getting smashed in my luggage. There was more padding in the bottom of the shoe than I expected so that was nice. And they didn't take up a lot of room in my luggage. They were fine walking around for about a mile, but longer than that and they dug into the backs of my heels. I used chafe cream when I put them on, and that helped a little. They also seemed to run a bit small. I usually wear between a 9 and 9.5. I got these in 9.5, and they were tight. It wasn't uncomfortable, but my big toes were noticeably shoved into the ends of the shoes. Would I buy these again?

They do have a bit of cushion to them and even though I can tell they're very thin, I can wear them to work all day (office job/sitting most of the day) and they don't hurt my feet and no blister rub on the heels. Would I wear them when I have to stand/walk for long periods? Definitely not, but for casual wear with minimal standing/walking (20is-30ish minutes at a time) they're not bad at all.

I'm not sure the difference in these verses the other UA shirts I have, but these are a little more uncomfortable.

The 30s I got fit well in the legs, aside from length (which isn‚Äôt a problem because of the ties); however the waist is so large that if I tie the drawstrings as far as they will go, the part of the pants near the fly jut out awkwardly, and the drawstring is visible across my belly because it‚Äôs tighter than the pants, and the pants are being suspended by it. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if I didn‚Äôt tuck in my shirts; but it‚Äôs easily fixable by replacing the drawstring with elastic, which I will do because these pants are AWESOME and I want to live in them forever.

Made with a blend of 50% cotton and 50% polyester, this midweight sweatshirt is perfect for everyday wear. The fleece material is incredibly soft and warm, making it perfect for cooler weather. Not only is this sweatshirt comfortable, but it's also made to last. Double-needle stitching at the neck and armholes ensures that the sweatshirt won't fall apart after a few washes. The ribbed crewneck, cuffs, and hem help the sweatshirt hold its shape over time, so it won't stretch out or lose its form. The best part? This sweatshirt is eco-friendly! The cotton used in the sweatshirt is sourced from American farms, which means you can feel good about your purchase. And if you're looking for a more sustainable option, Hanes recommends washing the sweatshirt in cold water to reduce energy usage.

So started looking at runners reviews. As my daily activities are more physical and up and down. A runner who is also a reviewer tried several different brands, from a variety of price points. These were in the lower to mid price range, and I thought I'd give them a shot. I was not disappointed. They didn't cause blisters, but my shoes for crews did. Plenty of room for my toes to move without discomfort. They are extremely lightweight and the soles(though marked as neutral) are actually very bouncy and supportive. My feet are very narrow and I almost got smaller ones, but glad I didn't as these are perfect.

My feet tend to slide so I learned to wear thicker socks and tie my laces in a heel lock. I returned this pair and bought another in wide width. Only downsize is there are very few color options in the wide widths. I‚Äôve worn Altras for years because of their zero drop and wide/natural foot shape. I like the cushioning in Brooks and I‚Äôm on my feet 10+ hours a day. Once I found the right type of Brooks (they‚Äôre all different) and the right size, I‚Äôve enjoyed wearing them.

PROS: Pulling it up after stepping in was easy and after making all the adjustments I was pleased. I hardly wear any shapewear but this is something I could see myself wearing everyday for support. It is not going to give you an hourglass figure if you are not close to that (such as myself) but it will smooth out and and flatter the mid section. I personally wore it without a bra but i had another regular cami and little sweater on top. It will not provide nip coverage, material too thin. CONS: I ordered a nude color but it was more of a beige color. Also, the straps are set a little closer together than the cami I wore on top making the coverage under the arm not as secure. I can see someone that struggles with under arm bulge having a hard time containing it in this cami. I would find myself readjusting when putting it on until i just settled but throughout the day i can feel the small gap between my armpit toward the front of my chest.";Nice smoothing effect;real;real;B07Q523P8M;65;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;SHAPERMINT Scoop Neck Compression Cami - Tummy and Waist Control Body Shapewear Camisole;18095;4.0;10;2023-04-29 08:20:24.699

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883cce;R2UH0H5XFH16FV;;2021-11-07;TRUE;B01JQTN8SQ;5.0;"I've been searching for the last year or so for good shorts with either velcro or buttons on the back pockets. I like carrying my big wad of cash in my back pocket so I want to make sure the roll of 20s don't fall out when I sit down somewhere. I've been buying Docker brand shorts for many years, but they no longer make their dress shorts with secure back pockets. This being Arizona where most of the year it's luke warm to hot weather you really need a bunch of shorts to wear near year-round. So I thought I'd try these Amazon branded ones, and bought a size 32 with a 9"" inseam in the cheapest color they had just so I could try them out (color teal for around $13). This way if I didn't like them even after breaking them in and washing them it wouldn't be a great financial loss. Packaging is easy and generic: inside a simple plastic bag and a small tag. No stickers, nothing else to have to remove. Just take out of the bag and remove the simple, generic, barcode tag. I noticed that the stitching was solid with sturdy thread, unlike a lot of other brands that cost twice as much and yet seem to scrimp on the thread. These feel very well made. The buttons are solidly stitched on as well and should last a long time without falling out. Zipper runs up and down very well also. When I first put them on I thought the inseam might not be the short 9"" that I prefer because it felt like it was a tad too long and was rubbing the back of my thighs, which really annoys me, hence my desire to always buy shorts with the shortest inseam. Well, I almost returned them at this point, but thought, ""what the heck, for $13 I'll wear them some more and give them a try"". Well, after a couple of hours of wearing them and walking around all over the place the hem softened up enough that it no longer bugs me by rubbing against the back of my thighs. So that's definitely a plus for me! I started to give these a one star downgrade for the only nit I have against these shorts: the front pockets seem to be about 1/2"" to 1"" shorter than I prefer. I would prefer to have the pockets be just a little bit deeper, in which case I'd give them a solid five stars. But because of this, I'll give them 4.51 stars and just round up for the overall very good quality and really good price. They're not quite Docker's quality, but they come close. The only difference, besides the pockets being a little bit shallower, is that while the cloth material is pretty thick (compared to many other brands I've bought over the years), it's still a fraction of a mill less heavy cloth than Docker's. So buy them if you want to try out something different that's nearly as good as top end brands, but costs a third of the price. But if you carry a big wallet in your front pocket then maybe not. But my Samsung Galaxy S21 does fit well in my front pocket along with my smallish wallet. I just wouldn't recommend carrying two big items in the same front pocket. PS I'm going to buy a few more of these to replace my worn out Docker's";Spot-on fit and very good quality for the price;real;real;B01JQTN8SQ;68;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;"Amazon Essentials Men's Classic-Fit 9"" Short";35358;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:20:47.950

Firstly, the shorts are made of high-quality materials and seem to be durable and well-made. They're also quite comfortable and my son reports that they're easy to move around in, which is a major plus for active kids. However, I find that the shorts have an odd fit that looks a bit strange on my son. They seem to bunch up in the crotch area, which gives them an awkward appearance. This is not a major issue, but it is noticeable and can be a bit distracting. Additionally, the sizing seems to run a bit small. I had to order a size up from my son's usual size in order to get a comfortable fit, which was a bit frustrating. Overall, while the Under Armour Boys' Shorts have some positive qualities such as their high-quality materials and comfort, the odd fit and small sizing are drawbacks that make them only an average choice for my son's wardrobe.;High-quality materials and seem to be durable and well-made;fake;real;B0874WW9DQ;71;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Under Armour Boys' Prototype 2.0 Logo Shorts;6238;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:21:11.043

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883cd2;R1412PDSLRZC2W;;2023-04-21;TRUE;B07C3D5W7F;5.0;I've bought so many different brands of shapewear underwear, and they usually are super tight, which is probably to be expected. They usually dig in at the waist, or they're just a bad fabric, shiny and un-breathable. These are perfect!! They cover all your sins, not too high or low, plus they feel very soft and kind of fit like a pair of cottony underwear. I'm a size medium in most clothes, so I bought these in a large hoping to avoid the uncomfortable tightness. But the large was maybe just a tiny bit larger than I'd want if I'm looking to compress a little. However, they're excellent for daily wear, and for smoothing down in most clothing, such as slip on pants, dress pants, khakis, etc. So I'm keeping these and I'm going to order a medium as well, for wearing under dresses or closer-fitting items.

So I have ordered the next size up and hope they will shrink to the proper size. I do not want to have to wash my underwear in cold water and hang to dry. Also I found the fabric too thick/warm for a 80 degree day. My back was sweating under them. However they are still the most comfortable underwear I have tried in 2 years.

I finally decided to try crocs and wow what a difference! So easy to put on even if my hip is acting up and easy to clean and the material they are made of, it is impossible to lean into the insole and so my posture is more upright and correct and it makes my hip pain much more manageable.

My feet hurt a little at the end of the day but nothing at all like they did before wearing crocs! I recommend these to anyone who needs an easy way to put on shoes and who has foot pain. I also notice that with less foot pain I am not exhausted at the end of the day like I was. Being in pain is just exhausting and I am able to do things when I get home at the end of the day vs. just sitting and putting my feet up after work and not being able to do much at all, just recover so I can tackle the next day.

They will not last you forever. They‚Äôll made well, but the material is a little thin. Not see through then, and not tear in a week thin either. I went to a thrift store and found 2 tops and one bottom. Then I bought two sets from here to match the prices I found. So now with the $15 I spent at the second hand store with the $55 I spend on these, im set for about a month until I can invest in a little nicer ones. In the mean time there is no doubt that these sets will work well for me. I have already washed and dried a few times and the cut of these did not warp nor did they fade ugly. Once washed you can tell they‚Äôre washed, but they don‚Äôt look old-old or anything. I think these are great for those of you who do not like second hand but are a budget.

Thus, I ordered a large, when I wear a medium, while wondering if I'd made a mistake. BUT NO. Everyone who shared these shorts are tiny were right. Medium would have been quite constricting as the large is very snug. Also, I hate panty lines, so I cut out the inner panty, because I wear thigh length leggings, anyway. Being a modest woman, these shorts are just a tad too short for me, but they wouldn't be so for the average woman - meaning? They're not booty shorts. The backside is actually longer than the front. Overall, they're a good purchase, given the color is bright and cheery, and the cut allows for thicker thighs, which I have. I wish they had one more pocket, though, as I carry my keys, walkman and handkerchief during runs. That's the only truly awkward issue. Update: I've gone running wearing these shorts and they're just what I needed. There were no bunching issues. while I solved the pocket problem by pinning a cut off toe and foot section of a misfit sock. I just placed another pair in another color in my shopping cart.

They weren‚Äôt lying- it is very comfortable once on, and it will only stick once, so it takes doing a practice run. You can not Re-position it. Doing a practice application seems kinda wasteful but I really do suggest you do it. Every body is going to be different, so it‚Äôs best to try it out and throw some away. That way you are prepared with knowledge for when it‚Äôs important you get it right. After your practice application you should know exactly where you need it to be and then stick it on once and leave it. It held strong where I stuck it once and left it. It almost immediately rolled off where I tried to re-position it. It‚Äôs super comfortable and supportive. The kit comes with 2 sets of silicone nipple covers that you put on first. Put the tape on over those. It also came with what I think is double sided garment tape although they call it something else on the packaging. Narrow white precut strips that can be used to stick your garment to itself or to you wherever the garment wants to sag open or flop around. I haven‚Äôt worn the boob tape for a long time or in a humid environment, so I don‚Äôt know how long you can depend on it. But plenty of other reviewers say if you put it on clean dry skin it lasts hours and hours.

I would historically be described as ""athletic"" or ""husky""; I'm not fat but have relatively large thigh and ass (T&A) muscles. As such, finding OTS pants that fit around my T&A comfortably, but that don't leave me swimming in them at the waist, or in a short-enough inseam has always been a bit of a trick. More recently, the trend toward ""skinny"" pants - oddly even on men - has made this historical challenge a near impossibility: the last time I went to the mall to buy pants, the best I could do was get something that made me feel very uncomfy and was on the border of offensive in its contouring and reveal of my man-parts (not sure where the 'skinny' guys are hiding their C&B!). Anywho, I've been testing out a few styles of pants from Amazon's Essentials offering and have been generally pleased. These pants in very good. 1) They fit pretty nicely. Fit as expected in waist and inseam, but yet have just enough room through the T&A without them looking like baggy clown pants. I do seem to have some gathering in the crotch, but it is not severe. See (2), below. 2) The fabric is not stretchy, so fit is key. Given my unusual weight fluctuations, time will tell ow well the pants to adapt to my changing physique. At the moment, I'm on the higher end of my range, yet the pants dont feel overly tight. I suspect the fit will improve to ""perfect"" when I'm toward the lower end. 3) The material and construction seem fine.

They have NEVER fallen apart, only got to where the back part where your foot goes in would buckle a little so I would have to straighten them back up when putting them on. I only got new ones so I could wear that pair for gardening or outside work. I originally got them to get rid of heel spurs and my son‚Äôs heel spurs (the reason I recommended them to him) are gone after a short time of wearing them as well.

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883ce7;RR7AOA2G5RO6P;;2020-09-25;TRUE;B00XK12YGY;4.0;Yes this color is described as a washed jean but that still should appear like the photo and not have areas rubbed lighter colored such as the knees. If so then the photo needs to show this in the thumbnails here on Amazons sale page when you select this color. IT DOES NOT. So it lost a star for that and I feel like making it two to three stars down really. However I needed new jeans as I am on my last new package of my favorite pairs no longer made and wanted a true dark shade. I have lighter blues that are fine for my daily casual wear but now and again when I feel like being a bit more dressed up or casual dressed up I like the dark or black jeans. So I ordered this color because Portland color was out even though even today it still shows you can select my size but when you do your told it is out of stock. I would now be afraid to order the Portland too for fear it too would come with pre scrubbed washed out knees. I prefer to wear my darker jeans in by myself and buy the lighter blues where I am less fussy but even those I do not want pre-rubbed lighter spots that can literally damage the jeans and cause them to wear out much faster than I would myself do it. For size a P length fits best in length these are short and in some brands that is just fine but in these they are still fallng below my instep so I either have to roll them up a bit or hem them shorter. It's the reason I buy the short or petite so I don't have to. I also ordered a pair of black in the petite but only because they did not come in the short and today they don't have the petite size I ordered either in black. I am not sure when Amazon and seller will get a good update on color and size selection but dang this is annoying because almost none are available in most of the common sizes regular or short or petite. I will buy a regular length and just hem too if that was even available. So I've been buying this brand via Costco for years now however the last time I bought two pairs from Costco last fall they did not fit and had to be returned. This is a big problem because we live 100 miles from Costco or 200 mile round trip so it's not like we go often. Meantime I was shocked they did not fit as it was my regular size and same size I ordered here and Costco's did not fit. Also my last two pairs of Gloria's did not wear well while I have a pair now over 5 years old of her's that are still almost like new and comfortable and worn a lot so quality in materials used and size variations in one size as of late is just not reliable like it used to be. Gloria are you even listening? Right I know no one is. With Covid now hitting I thought I'd be able to pick up my basic jean needs with this order and going off the thumbnail photos where there is no worn spots on the knees or lighter spots anywhere else shown or highlighted via photos provided with that color selection I ordered with fingers crossed they would fit. Fit was ok though could be a bit better but sometimes with most jeans you need to wear them a few times and wash a few times to find them fitting better. I suffer from chonic edema condition that changes my leg size but not usually size of jeans itself so a jean that hangs loose one day a week later could be much tighter so I am not a fan of the tight jeans and need some looser leg to them. But I do not want my jeans baggy by any means either. I just wish makers would stick with trusted materials and designs so you could feel secure in ordering the same style over the years. Brand, a design by the same name year to year in other words should continue to fit the same year to year in the same size and quality of material and workmanship also should be reliable from year to year.

They are very soft which is nice but there is one feature that keeps them from being five star to me. The waistband is just the fabric rolled in half so there‚Äôs no elastic or anything on the interior. Now I‚Äôm sure plenty of people prefer that but let me say why I don‚Äôt. Unless you have a very flat belly, there is nothing to stop the waistband from slinking or rolling down so you constantly have to yank it back up. I find this to be aggravating. Especially because I have plenty of leggings that stay in place simply because there is a small band inside giving it structure. This is one change I wish they could make.

I love the quality of heavy cotton t-shirts every since I tried the Gildan heavy cotton line approximately 7+ years ago. However, I was shocked to see such negative reviews in the comment section about receiving poor quality t-shirts, different colors and sizes because I had never experienced anything like that before from the Gildan Store. It's was to a point that I was afraid to give it a try, but decided to since Amazon has free returns via several different routes. I did not waste any time checking the packaging and t-shirts thoroughly upon arrival. What I received is 10 (ten) heavy cotton authentic Gildan t-shirts as advertised. All in the right size as advertised and pure white as the snow. I now feel like I can go forward with ordering some black and heather gray ones. I did not want to order too many without knowing that things had not declined as far as quality and/or the company's ethics or business practices goes. Lastly, for the first time, I decided to order one size up because they do shrink over time. Especially, if you're drying them in the dryer vs hanging them out to dry. These are NOT marketed as pre-shrunk t-shirts. So, I do not understand why people are surprised when they do. All t-shirts that are not pre-shrunk usually shrink within the very first wash or shortly thereafter.;Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton T-shirt, Style G5000, Multipack, Color: White;real;real;B0828MYG9M;96;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Gildan Adult Heavy Cotton T-Shirt, Style G5000, Multipack;78718;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:24:25.072

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883ceb;RIFOVF75QFO5V;;2023-04-21;TRUE;B0014JGDUC;5.0;I've been cooking professionally for over a decade and have used these shoes for over half that time. These things are great for a lot of reasons but the main reason is cleanliness. I like to find a high pressure hose at the end of my day and just spray the whole shoe clean, inside and out. Give them a quick wipe and they look good as new, not to mention the benefits of cleaning the inside of the shoe. These things hold up against the heat impressively well. I've had 350 degree fryer oil right out of the drain valve spilled on my entire foot, the shoe held up but it got inside over the top. Being a clog style shoe i was able to quickly remove the shoe, dump out the grease inside, spray it out and it was unaffected. The none slip sole is the expected pattern for a non slip shoe and works as it should. The material forms to your foot over time making the shoe a nice fit specifically for your foot and the bouncy rubber absorbs the impact of hard kitchen floors against your feet. i've had these shoes last a couple years but that was really too long, i like to get a new pair once a year to keep them fresh. Downsides to these shoes is they don't breathe at all being all rubber and when your feet sweat nothing gets absorbed by the shoe. I wear wool stocks made for hot conditions to help wick the moisture and that helps for me. If you live in a place where it snows you should use a different shoe for commuting as the heel is exposed and snow makes its way into the back easily. Give them a try if you work in a commercial kitchen, for the price they are a great option.;Best for Industrial Kitchens;real;real;B0014JGDUC;97;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex Adult Men's and Women's Bistro Clog | Slip Resistant Work Shoes;55360;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:24:32.652

I can see how they might be good for some situations, and they may wear down less quickly than the regular Crocs outsole -which don't last long- but I don't like this outsole. Unfortunately I have two pair with this type of sole. One of the photos shoes the sole with some gravel stuck to it. The other photo shows this Croc without holes and a brown pair of winter Crocs, without holes that I've had over 10 years and wish they still made them, plus another type with holes on the top only.;Hate the outsole;real;real;B0014JGDUC;97;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Crocs Unisex Adult Men's and Women's Bistro Clog | Slip Resistant Work Shoes;55360;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:24:32.652

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883cec;R2XJHHI9XNP3XW;;2020-02-09;TRUE;B003DTMPQ2;4.0;My usual measurements are 36 under the bust and around my rib cage, and 42 around the bust, so all my bras are 36F. I am currently pregnant with our third baby, however, and my cup size pretty much went up two cups overnight. I swear, I could feel them expanding, and Lawd save me- I‚Äôm only thirteen weeks pregnant. I am still a 36 in band size, but have blossomed into an H cup with a bust measurement of 44 inches. As a busty woman in her mid thirties, I don‚Äôt mess around with garbage bras. No Lane Bryant crap for me either- if it doesn‚Äôt last and do the job for at least three years, I‚Äôm not wasting my money on it. My favorite bras are Elomi (I also have had luck with Anita and La Mystere) which I frequently find on sale (look online, and they can often be found in the $30-50 range, which is excellent) But. I‚Äôm pregnant and have six months to go, and who knows what these beauties are going to do once my milk comes back in. I need something to carry me through the next six months, and then my size is likely to change again. I‚Äôve ordered (and returned) quite a few bras in the twenty dollar range off of amazon already, and here is what I can tell you: The Vanity Fair bra looks nice but isn‚Äôt the most amazing bra I‚Äôve ever worn, it seems sturdy enough with decent enough fabric and stitching that it should last a couple years. It‚Äôs perfectly smooth, so it will work with Jersey knits and under thin fabrics. The bra is true to size, has great lift and shape, and gets the breasts looking perky as well. It‚Äôs comfortable, and seems like a work horse kinda bra- not too flashy, but gets the job done. The only slight oddity with this bra is that on me it seems to push my breasts slightly outward so that they are pointing more to my left and right than usual. Because I really need bras that fit RIGHT NOW I am going to overlook this minor glitch, because my husband didn‚Äôt think it was noticeable and he was really staring. Bless his heart. I‚Äôd give this bra three stars normally, but it gets an extra half star at the moment because of the low price and it suits what I need right now. The Bali Passion For Comfort minimizer bra was the worst on me, smashing my breasts flat in the center and then turning them to the east and west corners of the globe... odd effect. Lilyette by Bali Women‚Äôs Beautiful Support Lace Minimizer is well made with sturdy fabric, and seems like it will last a while, but I don‚Äôt entirely love the minimizing effect. True to size- It has decent lift, but does flatten them slightly, which probably just isn‚Äôt for me. If you DO want to look a cup size smaller this would be a good pick. The Lilyette by Bali Women‚Äôs Enchantment Three Section Minimizer Bra looks lovely on. It is true to size, and is a pretty bra, comfortable to wear, and gives excellent lift and shape. No spilling out over the top while I‚Äôm gardening, chasing my kids, and walking, and no digging in or discomfort. It has zero minimizing effect on me at all, so I‚Äôm not sure why it was labeled as a minimizer. Although this has been my favorite twenty dollar amazon bra thus far, the problem I foresee with this bra is that the lining is super thin and flimsy- this bra can never go into a dryer, and honestly you NEED a garment bag to wash it in or it will likely come apart and snag in the wash. I‚Äôm going to hand wash and line dry these. Because I only need it for six months, I believe it will hold up with extra care. I sincerely doubt the bra‚Äôs ability to last over a year though, if that. Delimira women‚Äôs full coverage non-foam floral lace underwired bra: oh wow, this bra is pretty on. I got it in my current size, but the lace on the cups is so stretchy and loose that the cup itself provides no lift or support. The back band is also extremely stretchy, so even on the tightest set of hooks, it feels a bit loose, and no real support is happening here. All the support rests on the shoulder straps, which are also verrrrrry stretchy. This bra looked so nice on me I wanted to keep it, but realistically once I wore it a few times it would stretch out to the point where it would be utterly useless. I am going to go down a band size and see if that helps, but I can‚Äôt currently recommend this for an all day wear if you like a lot of lift. This would be a wonderful bra for wearing around the house and looking sexy in!

It is a little more stiff and scratchy than the more expensive bra, and actually feels more scratchy than before I washed it. (It was washed in Dreft and Downy Free.) I will update again when I've worn it for more than 3-4 hours. I purchased a similar bra at a custom fit store on Saturday. It was $86. This one arrived the following Monday. It fits every bit as well and is actually a little more comfortable. And considering it was less than half the price of my first one, it's really a winner! They didn't have the cup size I need. (Nobody ever does, apparently a 36 or 38 I is not common.) Anyway, I ordered an H in the next band size up. And while it doesn't actually touch my chest between my breasts, it's close. I'm pleased and am going to reorder in black as well a backup in beige. It isn't itchy/scratchy and has four hooks. The straps are good and wide.

644cb0dbedd6fb90e1883ced;R349T1OZXTC3AD;;2023-04-23;TRUE;B00A7NDT3A;3.0;This shoe cleaner does a great job of cleaning shoes, you can check my before and pictures for proof of its efficiency. It is really gentle on the shoe material, and gets rid of some really pesky stains. Now for the reason I've given this 3 stars. The scrubber is really freaking painful. Like wow. Using the scrubber for more than 2 minutes leaves indents on your palm that really dig in, and welts/callouses as well. This scrubber is made of solid wood, which is nice, but what isn't nice is the fact that it's literally designed like a brick. There's no ergonomic features or design elements that make it easy to hold or handle, and zero comfortable ways to use it. The edges are barely rounded, so they're pretty much squared, and there is no real way to hold the brush. When you're trying to get a stain off your shoe, you sometimes need to put in a little elbow grease to really get it out. This scrubber makes sure that if you put in some elbow grease, you'll have the scars on your palm to prove it. I would equate using this scrubber to taking a brick and pushing it into your palm while rubbing it against a wall. There's nowhere for your fingers to grip, the hard edges push and bite into your palm, and the friction from the scrubbing leaves your hand sore and raw. Really a horrible experience. Like come on guys, I can design a better scrubber in CAD in 3 minutes. Rounded top with nice curving filets, small indents on the side for thumb and pinky placement, and a curved front and back for palm and front finger resting. No more raw palms, and an easy grip. I really debated giving this 4 stars instead of 3 stars, because a bad scrubber shouldn't take away that much from the product, especially since the product is primarily the shoe cleaner and not the scrubber, but you can't really use the shoe cleaner without the scrubber, so it's kind of a necessity. Therefore subtracting 2 stars is fair in my opinion. The scrubber is so hard and painful to use, that I found myself not really able to clean the second shoe as well as the first, as my hand was really raw. I tried just using a towel, but it didn't really get at the stains as well as the scrubber, so it's definitely necessary. I'd definitely recommend this product for its profiency in cleaning shoes and removing stains, but the horrible scrubber really detracts from the whole experience.;Great product, painful, underwhelming scrubber;real;real;B00A7NDT3A;99;Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry;Pink Miracle Shoe Cleaner Kit with Bottle and Brush For Fabric Cleaner For Leather, Whites, Suede and Nubuck Sneakers;31820;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:24:48.051

So far they have been very durable and extremely comfortable and soft! I do have some things I‚Äôm not super happy about though. And the first complaint, which is explained next, will probably keep me from buying this particular brand again. First, regarding the pillowcases, nice stitching accents on the end of ONE side. That was a bit disappointing that it was only on One side and not both. However, what is Really disappointing is that the edge of the side Without the stitching isn‚Äôt really tacked down at all! What I mean is, although it is folded under to match the stitched edge, it is Only tacked at the edge of each corner where the decorative stitched edge ends. The rest of that edge side, you can put your whole hand, and more, underneath that ‚Äúflap‚Äù that‚Äôs there because of not being stitched down in any way!! I can see this becoming an issue the longer they are used. Also, my top sheet hasn‚Äôt been pressed right at the top so that the exposed edge is Very obviously uneven when turned over the blanket (or Anytime you look at the top edge of the flat sheet). Perhaps I can iron it myself to be correct, but I haven‚Äôt yet tried it. So that was a by disappointing, but definitely not a deal breaker. And lastly, I have two cats and these sheets, because of their texture (which I actually Love especially against my skin!) are Super fur magnets!! Every single day I must ‚Äúde-fur‚Äù my sheets and pillowcases. Most of the time this fur is Not obvious to the naked eye. MOST of the time, but you Will see pieces where it has rubbed against something and made a tiny ‚Äúpile‚Äù of fur. So if you use something to get the fur off, you find there Quite a bit More fur that wasn‚Äôt so obvious! I often use a little water on my hands to remove the excess fur, which does come off easily. For me, living with fur is a way of life, so this fact isn‚Äôt necessarily a deal breaker for my family. But it IS rather annoying to need to ‚Äúde-fur‚Äù these sheets and pillowcases pretty much every day. Still, all in all I pretty much really love these sheets, with my major issue still being the lack of ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù on the pillowcases. And, because of that particular detail, I doubt I would purchase This brand again.;Great sheets for feel and color, but there are a couple of drawbacks for me.;real;real;B01M16WBW1;1;Home & Kitchen;Queen Size Sheet Set - Breathable & Cooling Sheets - Hotel Luxury Bed Sheets - Extra Soft - Deep Pockets - Easy Fit - 4 Piece Set - Wrinkle Free - Comfy ‚Äì White Bed Sheets - Queens Sheets ‚Äì 4 PC;241058;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:25:03.155

This sheet set actually has enough elasticity in the bottom fitted edge that it pretty much stays in place all through the night. When I get up in the morning it's just a matter of pulling up the top sheet, blanket and comforter to make it again in just a few minutes. The width of the flat sheet on this set is enough to have an overhang of several inches on both sides of the bed as well as long enough to easily tuck in across the bottom of the bed. For the week prior to receiving these I had tried yet another set. By the time morning came I had to take the bed completely apart in order to make it up so it would be comfortable come night fall. The top sheet of that set would also come completely pulled out taking with it the blanket and the comforter. The only negative I can say about this set is that I don't care for the pillow cases not being finished all the way around the opening. I iron all my cases and it not only makes it more difficult to press but it also makes the bed look ""not quite finished"" to have the back side opening so obvious.

Yes that's right ONE set of sheets. Every week it was the same. Strip the bed. Wash the sheets, dry the sheets, remake the bed. Over the 2 years my one poor set of sheets took a beating.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c28;R1XMCVWCZZZUNA;;2023-02-02;TRUE;B0154AS4T4;5.0;Fits perfect. I recently bought a new bed mattress for myself, and my father, and have noticed that some of the older sheets that normally sit on the mattress were too loose or when you lay on them, the sides un pinch them selves or barely hold on (overly loose). Keep in mind that my old mattress was a standard classic mattress from at least 22 years ago. All the new mattresses they sell now are a hybrid or gel and tend to be either 14 inches or 12 inches sometimes even smaller or higher depending on the variety. If you‚Äôre like me, it‚Äôs easier to buy the bed sheet for the exact size of the mattress if you buy these. For example, a queen bed would get a queen mattress covers, but make sure the bed sheet can wraparound precisely on the mattress size. Try to avoid, for example a 14 inch, that can accommodate an 18 or 17 inches 'deep pockets'. Through personal error, I have found out there either too loose, shift constantly, or they slide loose and sometimes they‚Äôre not tight so it ends up overly loose in the center. These bedsheets from Amazon are perfect. Tightly wraparound and hold on almost like stockings. I very rarely have to slightly push it to the side from the middle after using it for a week it‚Äôs retaining structure. Very happy with it and they don‚Äôt break the bank either. Nothing negative to say they are a little bit see-through probably 5 to 10% but nothing major. UPDATED: 2/17/2023 Everything I said in the review is still stands, has not come undone. The bed that I have the image is a hybrid 14inch. It has mini coils (3 inches) the rest is a foam/gel type liquid contouring type of bed. (soft top/medium firmness). Stayed on perfectly after I decided to wash the covers. I then remove the same cover from my dad's bed and noticed that it was only very tiny lifted in the portion where he was sleeping, but did not come undone. His is a 12 inch version of this one but it's 100% contouring type of bed that molds towards the body, so obviously it constantly shifts with movement. It stayed on, never came undone and no longer slides off by one of the sides and ends in random places. Very happy with it! Yes. buy the exact type of size mattress cover and avoid the deep pocket variety or the kind that say they can handle your mattress size, but go 3 to 4 inches more. Those are better for classic bed spring. Newer bed factors play a role like pure gel/foam/hybrid etc. Using common sense, the constant shifting and contouring toward the body of anyone on the bed moves around little by little the softer it goes. A lot of deep pocket variety don't have a string you can pull if you have a 12/14 inch newer mattress. Very happy I don't have to waste time every morning now because it slid off on one side or came almost completely undone in the center, instead, I can just do a tiny touchup on top by hand, (flattening) pinching the sides (or where its needed). But rarely needed. I have also slept on the bed a few days with just the new sheet covers (no flat-sheet/comforter or pillows) and they still don't come undone.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c28;RSNKSW61P01RZ;;2022-11-14;TRUE;B0154AS4T4;4.0;"First, I love the color (spa blue). I really prefer crisp white percale sheets, but that doesn't work for my husband (he sweats a lot at night, so white sheets become yellow rather quickly). For whatever reason, I can't seem to find nice percale sheets like my grandma used to have. She never wasted money on high thread count, but her sheets were also crisp and fresh and smooth. All the sheets I have tried over the years end up being rough or they pill or they wrinkle. I had one set that I loved the feel of, but the top sheet would NOT ever give me a nice clean edge, even if I ironed it. So when we bought our new king-size bed and had to upgrade all our queen size bedding, I decided to take a chance on these microfiber sheets. They are thinner than I expected, but they seem to be sturdy, I hope. Only time will really tell. They washed up beautifully, and when I pulled them out of the dryer (TBH, it was 3 days later), there wasn't a wrinkle to be seen and no pilling. When we put the fitted sheet on the bed, it fit snugly, exactly as it is supposed to, without a wrinkle and without any loose sections that tend to annoy me when I'm in bed at night. The top sheet fit well, but I wish it were longer. The sides drape just right, but the length didn't give me much to tuck under the end of the bed, which is actually very important to me, as my husband is a rough sleeper and tends to pull sheets and blankets out if they aren't well-tucked. The pillowcases are much larger than I expected. We have good quality thick bamboo pillows that are dwarfed by these cases' length (probably extra 6 inches or more hanging loose at the end of the pillow), but they fit the pillows properly in every other regard, nice and smooth, snug without being tight. The sheets are smooth and soft. Not percale crisp, but a nice softness that might just convince me to give up on the percale dream. They also don't have that weird microfiber feel that so many others have (can't really describe it, but it just doesn't feel natural to me). I only have 2 complaints, and they are fairly minor. The biggest complaint is that the bottom sheet fits well, but it doesn't stay in place. Woke up in the morning with the sheet completely off in one corner. I'm hoping that it is just that we didn't get it on quite right the first time and maybe it will hold up better in the future, or maybe I'm going to have to invest in some straps to hold the corners in place better. The other complaint is more like a suggestion. our last set of sheets had a small tag on the fitted sheet that said ""Top or Bottom"" so we always knew which way to put it on the bed. Queen sheets were easier to identify ends from sides (obvious rectangle), as the king sheets are closer to square and harder to identify ends. We had to put the sheet on and try it, then pull it off and turn it before we knew the correct placement. I will put some kind of mark on it myself for future placement, but it would sure be nice if the manufacturer would include that tag from the get-go.";Good basic sheets, soft, wrinkle-free, but thin;real;real;B0154AS4T4;2;Home & Kitchen;Amazon Basics Lightweight Super Soft Easy Care Microfiber Bed Sheet Set with 14-Inch Deep Pockets - Twin, Bright White;365608;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:25:10.748

Compared to other sheets, these don't wrinkle much. These sheets are thin. Great for summertime I think. They're really comfortable to sleep on as you won't really find fuzz distracting you from your sleep. If you need sheets that are good for trapping heat, these probably aren't a good idea. Everything fits really nicely around the bed and I don't feel like I have to stretch it out too much to the fitted sheet on the mattress. I think the best feature about these are how it doesn't wrinkle after washing and drying. I've had many sheets that look terribly wrinkled after coming out of the dryer. These stay quite smooth and don't require ironing, which is a huge plus. Comparing to something like miracle sheets, I prefer these for the comfortableness. Will not do a good job with spills and liquids. It's thin so things will just soak through. You should always have a mattress protector anyways though. When comparing to miracle sheets, miracles sheets will dry really quick and retain less smell. These will stay damp so may require more frequent wash if you sweat or do nighttime activities in your bed. Overall, for this price, I would keep using these over other (more expensive) sheets on the market because of convenience and how they feel.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c29;R21F5D8859CD1G;;2020-06-18;TRUE;B00E4GACB8;5.0;I very rarely write reviews which is kind of stupid because I usually read reviews prior to getting certain products. Therefore I guess I will start now, hoping I can help someone decide wether or not this product is for them. Before you read this long review I want to let you know this is the BEST product I have ever used. Before I tell you about how AMAZING this product was I will tell you what kind of Ant üêú problem I had. Maybe someone can relate. I have a parrot and he is in a room that is near a window. With all the different types of food he eats and with the warmer weather that we started having in my area (NJ) I started seeing ants outside. That‚Äôs when I started seeing some ants coming in from the bottom left corner of the frame of our window. I have never had an ant issue with the 17 years I live hear. Even having my parrot and all the amounts of food he eats. For some reason last year during the spring time is when I saw these crazy little annoying bugs come in my house. These ants seemed to be a different type of ant. One I have never seen before. They were small but the minute you go near them they would run away or scatter away super fast. I have an exterminator on my block and he told us they were sugar ants. What the hell is a sugar ant? Lol. Well I was told that these ants hide out in your shower and in the kitchen because of the sugary foods around. Why are they found in a bathroom is beyond me. But I looked it up after what he said and everything he told us was what I read on line about ‚Äúsugar ants‚Äù. I mentioned that last year I had this problem and they were found behind the faucet in our shower. That‚Äôs another story. Anyway, before having an exterminator come into my house, I figured I would try to resolve the problem myself. So before buying this ‚ÄúAMAZING PRODUCT‚Äù, I purchased all the ‚ÄúRaid‚Äù products that come in the square plastic containers. The ones that come in white or grey containers. I put the Raid traps by the window and where else I thought they might come in. I actually tried the mixture of vinegar, sugar and water concoction that was told on line to use for these ants. But nothing worked. I doubt an ant even went to these traps because near my window they would go around those traps. I was getting frustrated because I skeeve bugs. And I was afraid of an exterminator coming in with my parrot living here. I wasn‚Äôt taken that chance of him dying with the chemicals. Anyway after coming to a dead end with the Raid traps I began reading and reading on so many products just to find a worthy product. That‚Äôs when I came across this product. It was very different than the normal products that are used to kill ants. So I figured why not, let me give it a try. I received my order really fast and was anxious to use them. After reading all the directions these baits were very easy to use. It comes in a thick clear rectangular container. To open it, it Reccomended to hold it up right and twist off the plastic top until it snaps off. It was a little tough for me to snap off the top like it says on the package. Therefore I used a pair of scissors to open the trap. Word of advise, if you need a pair of scissors to open your product, just make sure to keep the trap upright so the liquid doesn‚Äôt pour out. After opening the trap, I then placed this trap about 3-4 inches away from the bottom corner of the window. Right where I saw the ants coming in. They scurried away from me at first, but the minute I put this trap down it was shocking!! No joke. I was shocked to see all these ants go running toward the opening of this trap. The trap actually attracted more ants to come out of hiding to eat this food (crazy). I actually spilt a little bit on my windowsill and some ran to that and got stuck. But what was amazing to me was after I put the trap down and watching these ants go to it, it was shocking to see them run right back out of the corner of the windowsill. It was crazy. I just watched for a few minutes and to see them either get trapped inside the trap or grab some of the food in the trap and run back outside or wherever they came from. And by the end of the day they were gone. It‚Äôs about 2 weeks now since I only used one trap and I have yet to see another NASTY ANT!! Wahooo!!!! They are gone. This product is BY FAR THE BEST ANT PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!! This is noooo joke. Therefore you can count on me to continue to purchase and use this product for any ant problem that might arise again. I will never buy a different type of ant trap again. No matter how popular people feel the ‚ÄúRaid‚Äù products might be. The sprays are only wonderful for the outdoors but for the inside the ‚ÄúRaid‚Äù products are definitely not as effective as this product is. I actually gave my neighbor 2 traps and after a day or two they were gone by him as well. These traps are crazy how wonderful they work. I swear by this product and I know if you purchase these traps you will too. I will never buy another kind of ant traps again. These are the BEST kind of ant traps on the market by far!!! And mind you, I AM NOT making any kind of commission from this company for this product review. I am just sooo happy my ant issue is gone for now.

I put one behind our coffee maker and the other on the ground close to a crack that seemed to be where most of the ants were coming from. In the next morning I found 5 or 6 dead ants inside the bait station and no ants in our kitchen. It's been around 2 weeks now and the trap is still there with a bunch of ants in it but nowhere else in the kitchen.

I was expecting great things from this product, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the hype. Let's start with the bait stations. Sure, they look nice and compact, but don't be fooled, they still get in the way and I found myself constantly having to reposition them to keep them in place. And while the liquid ant killer seemed to attract a few curious ants at first, it wasn't long before they lost interest and moved on to greener pastures. To be fair, the active ingredient in this product - borax - is known to be effective in killing ants. But unfortunately, the TERRO T300B just doesn't seem to deliver the results promised on the package. Perhaps it's the strength of the formula or the overall design of the bait stations, but whatever the reason, I was left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. In the end, I would give this a three-star rating out of five. It's not a complete failure, but it's not exactly a success either.

The ants were the pretty standard black ants. The Terro feeders worked incredibly well. We placed a few along the pathways we noticed the ants. Within a hour or so they had discovered the feeders and their numbers increased, so much so that we could (finally) tell where they were coming in and out. We placed more feeders near the ingress/egress point. Once the feeders are out, be prepared for a disconcerting river of ants coming and going. Within 24 hours -- no ants, and it has been several days and the problem appears solved (knock on wood). An anecdotal observation: I'd suggest putting several traps/feeders out at once so you get maximum disbursement of the poison in the shortest amount of time -- that seemed to help in the swift resolution of our issue.

At first, I was like there‚Äôs no way these things work seems to be more and more and said they‚Äôre not dying in the traps there in the trap, and somehow they made it out, and it seemed for the first two days to have a bigger infestation. Unlike the pictures and previous reviews, I read. My results were a bit different, but very very satisfying nonetheless. I had not only a regular small, black ant problem. I had a large, carpenter ant problem. And yes, those are the ones that bite and tear stuff up I laid an entire box of traps out over the period of three days. It took about three days for the small black ants to all be eliminated. There was only about 10 black ants left in the traps after all is said and done. Batavia to return as I believe they took the poison back to their nest and must‚Äôve killed off their entire population. Now the carpenter ants it takes longer for it to work on them instead of going straight back to the layer like the other ants they tend to get incapacitated intend to wander all over your house and either end up dying curling up somewhere or crawling all the way into the traps on like the small black ants in dying inside of them. I highly recommend this trap to anybody that is looking to solve a manifestation in their home Skeptical, I am on mini fix it items especially for a very affordable price This is a no-brainer if you have any type of ant infestation in your home don‚Äôt think twice just buy these and get it rolling;Be patient people;real;real;B00E4GACB8;3;Home & Kitchen;TERRO T300B Liquid Ant Killer, 12 Bait Stations;94163;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:25:18.441

This might be the best thing I‚Äôve bought. The weather got a little warmer, and I noticed some tiny ants randomly in my 3rd floor apartment. I still have no idea where they got in, and they didn‚Äôt really seem to be going towards any area in particular. I tried peppermint oil around the doors and windows, but still kept waking up to 10-20 after killing most of them the night before. I put these out last night, left the ants alone, and they were gone within hours. This morning there are none. Granted it did snow yesterday-so we‚Äôll see once it warms up again.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c29;R3AWEAQWFIL0QR;;2023-03-07;TRUE;B00E4GACB8;5.0;For some reason, this winter, the ants have been a major PITA. Normally, we never get them but this year was different. We had ants in the kitchen, bathroom, hallway, and in one of the kid's bedrooms. Sprays work for immediate kill but sprays don't get rid of the problem. Ants will just find another way in. Traps - they take it home, and kill themselves which is what you want. This trap works very good, however, it does take the ants quite a while to find it and become interested. I ended up pouring a drop or two out in front of one of the ants. It found it and then brought a bunch of other ants to the trap. Soon, I had an ant column from the wall to the trap. I ended up opening another trap to shorten their commute time to the 1st trap. It's kind of gross watching them swarm. Many of them get stuck inside and then die in the syrup. Pretty soon, after about 2 days, the volume of ants went from many to just a few. Most of the ants are dead. I would also get dry ant traps too. Smear a bit of cat food juice on the inside lip of the trap to help the ants be more interested. In the end, the dry traps are easier to keep running. The wet ones - are juicy and prone to spilling. Not only that, they fill up with 000s of dead ants. I will say after 2 days, the ants are mostly gone. There are a few stragglers but the traps themselves seem worn out even though there is still liquid in it. The ants that are left ignore it - IDK why. After most of the suppression is done, go around and hit the edges with RAID to keep the rest out. Shoot the outside of your house as well for a barrier (outside of where you see them coming in).;It takes at least 2 days to wipe most of them up;real;real;B00E4GACB8;3;Home & Kitchen;TERRO T300B Liquid Ant Killer, 12 Bait Stations;94163;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:25:18.441

With its powerful 1500-watt motor, this machine can handle anything from blending smoothies to processing tough vegetables with ease. The 72 oz. pitcher is perfect for making large batches of smoothies or soups, while the 8-cup food processor makes prep work a breeze. One of my favorite features is the 16 oz. single serve cup, which is perfect for making a quick morning smoothie. The cup fits perfectly on the base and is easy to clean, making it a convenient addition to my daily routine. The machine is also surprisingly quiet, which is a huge plus when you're trying to blend up a storm early in the morning without waking up the whole house. Overall, I highly recommend the Ninja BL770AMZ Mega Kitchen System to anyone looking for a versatile, powerful blender and food processor combo.

That falls under my mistake rather than something wrong with the machine. I have really enjoyed the food processor, salsa and variations a few times and pesto twice.

I like how they keep may hair a bit smoother and they machine wash and dry easily. They do feel a bit like the cheap satin poly they are at first, but over time with using and washing they do get softer. I prefer these over a real mulberry silk pillowcase I had because they‚Äôre easier to wash; the mulberry silk kind of ‚Äúgummed up‚Äù over time and had less slip to it. That doesn‚Äôt happen with these. If you grab them right out of the dryer and don‚Äôt let them sit there crumpled, you can also pretty much avoid any wrinkles. After 3 years I decided it was time to replace them because they‚Äôd developed some pills and runs - but I also just throw them in the wash with my regular laundry every week, which probably contributed to that. This time around, I got some mesh laundry bags and plan to use those to protect the pillowcases from zippers, buttons, and other things in the wash. So far so good.

The next time I would try the beige because these are a little too far to the yellow side for my bedding, but it's pretty.

Got this cover to prevent them from taking hold in the mattress just in case. This is nice and soft for the mattress, while the box spring below is now taped inside a giant plastic bag meant for use while moving. I like that it has strong velcro right over where the zipper stops and it is very bright white, which will make it easy to see anything in case they get up on the bed. It doesn't feel or sound so plasticy as other covers, however it does have a thin lining of plastic like stuff on the inside, but you can't tell from the outside; it's nice and soft! Anyone who's interested, here's some other stuff we've been doing, hope it works: We already had a metal bed frame, and I think it might be what saved us so far. I invested in a steamer that goes for 40 minutes and used it all over the furniture, carpet, and in cracks and baseboards. I got some carpet sliding things for each foot of all furniture. These I chose instead of interceptors because we also put a smooth piece of packers tape on each leg, which hopefully will do that job of keeping them from crawling up, while the carpet sliders make it easy to move the furniture to steam and vacuum the carpet each week (and to re-treat every month or so). Pesticides we are using: a light dusting of food grade DE, barely perceptible is what I heard is best, so they will crawl right over and through, rather than around it. We used this in cracks and crevices and in the groove of each carpet slider. We got the one here on amazon that comes with a duster. I have used DE in the past without the aid of a duster and it is much harder to apply properly and DE can really easily get everywhere and make a big mess. Also Crossfire, really nice stuff, with clear easy to follow instructions. Unfortunately, like most apartment renters, we are subject to use a laundromat instead of a washer dryer in the unit. We bring our clothes there in pillowcases and toss the pillowcase in with the clothes. No need to use plastic bags IMO. We then us a hard plastic, smooth laundry basket, no grooves: make sure it's deep enough on the bottom so your clothes don't have a chance to touch the floor. We use this to pick up the laundry, it is cleaned off before and after. No clothing allowed on the floor, and for now we aren't using our dresser, just hanging everything up, socks and things like that inside a bag, hanging with everything else. And that's about it, so far so good. Good luck to all of you out there dealing with these mini vampires!!

They are thin, so they take up very little room in the laundry hamper and in the washer and dryer when balled up. They are easily air dried on a rack or clothesline due to their thinness. If one likes the feel of freshly washed, crisp sheets, these are not going to be your favorites; even washed and dried, they are never crisp, stiff, tight, or any of those kinds of words. If one likes the feeling of soft sheets, silky, smooth, flowing, then these may be your favorites. They seem colorfast; we bought the gray color and I cannot say they are any dingier or less vibrant than the day we bought them. These microfiber-style, polyester sheets absolutely show oil stains more than cotton sheets, and it does not wash out. This may be particularly true of the darker colored sheet sets and pillowcases. If one uses body oils (e.g Neutrogena Body Oil), Vaselines, skin creams, hair gels, or eats potato chips in bed, you may not like how these sheets look after a few months. This bedding will have you believing that your spouse has ordered a bucket of KFC and ate it at a pajama party while you were at work; don't worry, your wife isn't having an affair with Col. Sanders...it's just the sheets. These sheets have not shrunk and still can be easily placed on the bed. Even the fitted Mellanni sheet with elastic corners, unlike my usual cotton shrinky-dink sheets, doesn't snap up into my kisser while I'm making the bed. Thanks, Mellanni!

I went with a replacement because these sheets really are that comfortable. Customer service is outstanding, they did 2 day shipping that same day. Thankfully the new set arrived in perfect condition. I will continue to purchase these sheets knowing they take care of their customers. This is my second time buying a set of these sheets. The first ones I ordered were the Blue Madison's and they are literally the best sheets I have ever slept on and just beautiful. This time I ordered the Lavender set.

Since I threw away the packaging I can't return or exchange them:( They were mailed in a box without anything else except the same brand of extra pillowcases and those didn't have a single stain on them. They did not appear to be opened at all when I received them either.

Here's why: I finally got ahold of the company (I think I had the wrong contact info) & they responded almost immediately from that email. They sent over new sheets very quickly. So they have lived up to their ""Mellanni Lifetime Promise"" & it is appreciated. Now on to the quality of the sheets. Idk how to explain it but when you lay the flat sheet down and try to pull it more to one side, it feels like the other side is already tucked in. It's weird. Not bad at all - just weird. The sheets are smooth but not silky. That said, these are currently my favorite sheets. I recently bought 3 or 4 new sheets to find ""the one"" and so far, these are the best. I usually sleep warm but I don't find myself soaked in sweat with these. I have pets who sleep with me & that means their hair is everywhere. With these sheets, I don't feel every. single. hair. It's frigging amazing. These sheets are extremely soft. I havent noticed any changed in texture from washing them. My cat has gotten his claw snagged, which sucks but I'm used to it. I am definitely going to buy another set of these in a different color. I have already recommended them to my brother & he has bought them for himself & likes it as well. He said that he likes the pockets on the fitted sheet since he doesn't usually use the flat sheet. Older review: Pros: ‚Ä¢ Soft sheets. ‚Ä¢ Beautiful color/print. Cons: ‚Ä¢ The pockets are on the fitted sheet. ‚Ä¢ Two holes in the flat sheet. (See photos) ‚Ä¢ Flat sheet was a QUEEN instead of CalKing. (See photos) ‚Ä¢ Doesn't live up to the ""Mellanni Lifetime Promise"" (if you are not satisfied with your purchase at any point, for any reason, you can return it with no questions asked. That's the Mellanni promise...you don't even have to send back the product.) I ordered cal king sheets. We unfortunately didn't check them before throwing them into the washer & didnt see the issues until it was too late. As soon as we took the sheets out of the package, we loved how they felt. So so soft. We were very excited to put these on our bed. I cant talk about how well they are while sleeping though. I did know ahead of time that the pockets were on the fitted sheet but I am mentioning it because well, we would have liked them on the flat sheet instead. Amyways, we would have been happy with them regardless but as we were making the bed, I noticed a hole in the flat sheet. My fianc√© thought it was small enough to ignore so we continue trying to make the bed. He kept pulling the sheet all the way to his side & not leaving me any to tuck in on my side. We went back & forth until I realized something wasn't right. I decided to look at the tag and saw it said QUEEN. What?! How did we get a queen flat & CalKing fitted sheet? At this point, doesnt matter about the hole or the pockets, we can't keep it. I decided to look at the sheets more closely and noticed another hole. The problem is we ordered these sheets before the fires in CA. And then the fires got too close to our home for comfort. So the sheets got ignored and forgotten for a few weeks. It wasn't until we knew we were safe & didn't have to evacuate that we remembered the fresh & clean sheets we washed. But it was too late to return through Amazon. I decided to email the company before leaving a review because it seems like an easy fix - it wasn‚Äôt like we don't like the sheets because they sleep hot or some other reason (we don't know either way at this point), plus I saw their ""promise"". Well, we still haven't heard back from the company a few weeks later. I didnt want to leave a bad review but I feel that will be the only way to get their attention since they havent replied to my email. We have bought other sheets since then that we like. My fianc√© would rather us get our money back. I would honestly be happy to get a new set to try but I believe we should definitely get a refund since we did not get the sheets we paid for. I Just thought about: I do wonder how well the sheets hold up seeing as there were two holes in the ones we received.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c36;R3Q86CFOUHU284;;2022-05-27;TRUE;B000E28UQU;5.0;"For years I've been spraying my garden vegetable plants with hand spritzers. I apply water-diluted sulfur to my squash and melon leaves so they stay green and fresh, and water-diluted fertilizer to my tomato leaves. I need to spray both the tops and bottoms of leaves, but haven't been able to. I kept encountering the same problems with hand spritzers: spritzers that stop working all too soon; spritzers that will spray on tops of leaves, but not under leaves because they don't work when the nozzle is pointing upward; spritzers that can't fit in where I need to spray, so I can't get to the center of the plants; and spritzers that can't hold enough liquid to spray. I finally gave up and bought one of these. Before buying I could see I would be spraying with a wand, and that turned out to be ideal! I can spray in any direction (down or up) and I can reach in where I could not reach before. I'm not going back to hand spritzers! The included assembly instructions seemed confusing because they are for a number of different models, which made it difficult to figure out what I was supposed to do with this specific 1-gallon product. Turns out assembly and use are easy if you follow these steps: 1) Rinse out the jug. It may contain dust and bits left over from the manufacturing process. 2) Insert the filter-end (perforated cylinder end) of the white plastic tube. This will go to the bottom of the interior of the jug. 3) Secure the white plastic tube you just inserted, on the outside of the jug, with the threaded-fastener that's captive and sliding on the outer hose, put there for this purpose. You're making a water-tight seal, so make sure everything is first seated right, then twist the fastener snugly in place. 4) Attach the wand on the other end of the hose. You are again using a threaded-fastener that is sliding on the hose, and you are again making sure everything is first seated well before twisting snugly in place. That's it for the permanent assembly! For first-time use and to get a feel for how things work, fill the jug about 1/3 to 1/2 full with plain water. Drop the black pump into the top of the jug, with its handle on the outside. The handle is used to screw the pump into the jug so make sure the handle is down, into, and engaged in the top of the pump. Screw the pump in tightly since this has to be air-tight. Then unscrew the handle just a little, until it is loose and can be lifted up. Pump that handle to increase the pressure in the jug, and do it for longer than you might think necessary. Listen for leaking air where the pump is screwed in, and re-engage the handle into the pump to tighten it more if necessary. You want a lot of air in the jug so you can pressurize it for a lot of spraying. If you fill the jug too high there may be too little air to pressurize, and you won't be able to spray that much since not a lot will come out. You'll have to interrupt with more pumping sessions to get the pressure back up along the way. There's no law against this, it's just inconvenient. Filling half way or less makes the whole setup lighter for use, too. The wand has a handle you can squeeze, like at the gas pump, to get the spray going. Twist the end of the wand to change the shape of the spray, as you would with a garden hose. When you are done spraying, re-engage the pump handle into the pump, unscrew the pump and see and hear the pressure get released at the top of the jug around the edge of the pump. OK, you've gone through your practice session. Let's spray for real! Add water that dilutes what you are going to spray (use markings along the side of the jug to see 1-liter, 2-liters, quart, half gallon levels) and add your ingredient(s) to the water. You can shake the jug after it has been sealed and pressurized, then spray to your heart's content! Done for the day? Empty the jug and start again with plain water, then spray to clean everything out. I use this plain-water spray to water plants that could use it. Why waste the water? I am happy with my purchase, which is not something I always say. Of greatest importance? I see the effect on my plants!.

It takes a lot of effort and a pipe wrench to get the nuts screwed down tight enough to get a seal. That is redicules and was so not nessecary.

UPDATE. By January 2023 none of the health risks have decreased and remain a matter of concern. __ SOURCE. These OEM garden hoses are made by an East-Asia manufacturer with production facilities in both Taiwan and China, and that has also been listed in the past as a buyer of recycled plastic scrap. The hoses are sourced by the white-labeller Weems Industries Inc., doing business as Legacy Manufacturing Co. (Iowa), and sold under the Flexzilla trademark. MATERIAL. The hose is described as made from a hybrid polymer material, and has three layers. The polymer constituents are not identified, especially those for the innermost layer, which is touted to be safe for water drinking. As described below, a professional laboratory analysis of 2016 detected in *all* three layers of the Flexzilla hose a high concentration of multiple chemical additives that are used to make PVC flexible (phthalates), making evident that the hose material has considerable amounts of PVC throughout its entire wall. Thus, the hybrid polymer, which Legacy no longer hypes as a ""premium"" one, is merely a PVC compound. WATER SAFETY. In general, hoses without PVC are much less likely to have contaminants like heavy metals, flame retardants, or phthalates than hoses with PVC, especially if the PVC were recycled. I was not able to find verifiable evidence supporting the sales pitch that the hose is water-drinking safe -- curiously, neither the Legacy nor the Flexzilla website display this evidence at the time of writing this update. Despite that, when replying to a query on the Customer Q&A section on water potability, Legacy claimed ""the hose meets or exceeds the standards set by the National Sanitation Foundation"" (amzn.to/2LCiKT6). That foundation is a testing/certifying body whose name was changed to NSF International more than 30 years ago. At the time of this update, the NSF website does not have Weems, Legacy, or Flexzilla in its list of companies with NSF-certified products. Now, since Legacy's claim might have meant the hose was tested by a third-party lab for compliance with water standards, I did a further web search for an NSF/ANSI/CAN 61 test report of Flexzilla hoses over the last decade, but I did not find any. Alas, what I found was the _Garden Hose Study 2016_ of the Ecology Center (MI), which tested many hoses including a 50-ft 5/8"" Flexzilla, whose material is simply described as PVC. Multiple phthalates were found in all the three layers of the hose with the aid of an IR spectroscope (minimum detection limit of about 1% by mass). Contrary to Legacy's claims of safety, the Flexzilla hose was rated HIGH for phthalates, and received the negative evaluation of 'high overall level of concern' [see my figure with the test results]. This is bad news to those planning to use a Flexzilla hose for water drinking, watering vegetables and, especially, letting children play with it. PHTHALATES. Phthalates are chemical additives (""plasticizers"") used to soften the PVC's vinyl and make it flexible. They are water-soluble and not bound to the vinyl, so they easily leach from a PVC hose into the water of those drinking from it, particularly when the hose has been heated up by the sun. Like BPA, which is also used in vinyl production, absorbed phthalates can disrupt hormonal function, affecting children (both in utero and born) and adults. A decade after the 1999 EU's phthalate ban, several phthalates were PROHIBITED in the US in 2009 (15 US Code ¬ß2057c) above 0.1% in products for children under 3 years of age and toys for children under 12, and some other phthalates were provisionally BANNED. Canada adopted similar restrictions in 2011. The reason for this prohibition is that phthalates may increase the risk of allergic illnesses (asthma or eczema), IQ/behavioral alterations in kids, and pubertal breast changes in boys and girls. They are considered a risk of male genital defects during fetal development, and of reduced sperm counts in men. In 2018, a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that chemicals in plastic such as phthalates and BPA put children‚Äôs health at risk. Any product sold in California that contains any of six phthalates as well as a number of other toxic substances must display the Proposition 65 Warning : ""this product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Legacy's reaction to Q&A queries about the presence of phthalates in the hose has ranged from simply ignoring them, as in a 2014 query (amzn.to/3cbugD9), to answers bordering on fraudulence, as in a 2017 reply that the hose is ""phathalate [sic] free"" (amzn.to/2D5xQjT) despite that the Ecology Center study had been published the year before. Parsimoniously, that misleading reply can be interpreted as deceptive. Given the phthalates leaching from the hose's inner layer, which mix with the water output, and those from its outer layer, which accumulate on the hose surface, it is left to one's imagination what is the exposure risk in the image Legacy shows here of a child (it used to be a toddler in a prior version of the webpage) drinking from this Flexzilla hose held in his hand out in the sun. Despite Legacy's familiarity with the Prop-65 warning, it did not disclose it on its Amazon webpages for many years. Finally, perhaps relenting to criticisms of its non-transparent practices, it put the warning in 2021 in a ""Legal Disclaimer"" just above the Consumer Q&A section. But it was sloppily done -- in 6/2021, the warning did not appear when the 100-ft hose was selected; in 7/2022, it did not appear for the 50-ft, 75-ft, and 100-ft hoses; and in 1/2023, it again does not appear for the 100-ft hose. BLACK MOLD INVASION. About 4 months after I attached the hose to a reel (so it was kept dry off the grass or any other wet surface), it began to be invaded by black mold. This is shown in one of my attached pictures (which was taken after rubbing the hose with a dry paper towel to remove dirt), whose inset shows the same hose when it was installed. This fungal invasion is neither an isolated nor a rare case, as evidenced by the large number of reviews complaining of it. Handling the moldy hose left black sticky stains on my hands. Any mold-invaded object is a health risk -- back mold not only can produce a toxic mycotoxin (Satratoxin-G), capable of injuring olfactory sensory neurons in primate studies, but also release millions of tiny spores that become air- and water-borne, causing lung, ocular, and skin reactions in those sensitive to them. Plasticized PVC is susceptible to fungal attack because the additives can also serve as a nitrogen or carbon source, and, at least for several plasticizers, mold can degrade and deteriorate the plastic, making it brittle and allowing the mold to penetrate it even further. Of course, mold development in the inner surface of the hose is a MAJOR water safety risk, and the hose needs to be flushed to remove the mold flecks in the standing water inside. With a melamine sponge I could remove some surface mold stains or flecks, but not others or those deeper in the hose wall. Cleaning the surface will not remove the deeper fungal growth reaching inner layers, and is merely a temporary cosmetic fix : the mold returned after I removed the hose from the spigot and kept it in the garage. This is shown in my third picture, taken some months after removing the mold-invaded hose (the hose was hung in position for the sake of taking the picture). I contacted Legacy and spoke over the phone with a Tech Support agent who told me, with the polite laconism recommended in cross-examinations, that the company does not offer a solution for getting rid of the fungal invasion. After pressing the issue of health risks, I was told that ""no mold was found in the inner surface of a moldy hose"" that they claim to have dissected. Curiously, neither the dissection nor its results are publicly available. In contrast, some other reviews here show that mold can indeed develop inside the hose. My impression is that the company could hardly be more apathetic in relation to the potential health risk of these East-Asian made hoses it sells. WARRANTY. Its terms are customer-unfriendly. A defective hose would be replaced if you, after filling a form online, cut off [a] both ends of the hose, [b] its defective part, and [c] the print band ""Flexzilla by Legacy 5/8‚Äù ID Type 150 PSI WP"" (along with the 4-digit number), and [d] mail these pieces to Legacy at *your* expense along with the proof of purchase and return mailing instructions. No coverage is provided for the likely event that the non-anodized aluminum fitting of the hose fuses to the threads of the typical home brass spigot due to galvanic corrosion. Also, according to Legacy, though not legally affirmed by judicial opinion, the invasion of black mold is not covered by warranty. Tough luck for those customers who bought hoses that became Moldy Black (I bet Weems shall not trademark this color). It is most censurable that Legacy imitates the three legendary Japanese monkeys, albeit changing the proverb to SEE NO MOLD, HEAR NO MOLD, SPEAK NO MOLD. It is fair to conclude that Legacy considers the Moldy Black issue too frequent to be covered by its unfriendly penny-pinching warranty. --";Poor quality PVC hose with high PHTHALATES, rapidly invaded by BLACK MOLD;real;real;B003TFE7ZM;17;Home & Kitchen;Flexzilla Garden Hose 5/8 in. x 50 ft, Heavy Duty, Lightweight, Drinking Water Safe, ZillaGreen - HFZG550YW-E;71055;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:27:06.653

I connected this short 10' hose to the adapter and then connected a drain cleaning bladder to the hose. Stuck the bladder into the shower drain and turned on the water. When the bladder was full, I turned the water up to full pressure. Cleaned the drain in just a few seconds.

My biggest issue was not being able to fit it down in my cup holder. I saw Stanley cups and thought that was the dream cup. It holds 40 oz, keeps it hot/cold, still fits in the cup holder, and has a handle?! Awesome! Except I wasn‚Äôt about to pay that kind of money. I went looking for a dupe, read the reviews on Simple Modern‚Äôs, and decided to go for it. The shipping was slow, but it was worth the wait!! This cup is amazing! I drink way more water having it easily accessible with a straw at my desk. The water stays COLD for hours, so much that I got a brain freeze when I didn‚Äôt even start with ice. The handle makes it so easy to carry, and I love that it fits right in my cup holder. I‚Äôm not a coffee girl, so I haven‚Äôt tested it with hot drinks. When my friend saw my knock off, she asked if it leaks. I had it full of water and started tipping it over. It didn‚Äôt have a couple drops of water start coming out of the straw until it was 3/4 of the way upside down. She was so jealous! She showed me her Stanley cup, which started pouring water out before it even got 1/2 way there. LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! The only reason I took a star away was because of the screws in the handle. 1) They‚Äôre ugly and not covered. 2) If you let your hand slip over the screw/hole, it‚Äôs not a comfortable hold. 3) The screw on the bottom of my cup must‚Äôve been partially stripped when they assembled the cup because it sliced my pinky, and I ended up with a metal shard stuck in it. Once I checked for remaining pieces and got that smoothed out, I obviously won‚Äôt have to deal with that anymore. Just take a look when you first get your cup!

I try not to use just the standard ""weed and feed"" to our lawn and try not to do more than that. When I found these types of tools specifically to remove weeds, I was a bit apprehensive, as most, if not all, were rated low as they really don't work. I decided to go with this particular one since it was the only one rated five stars, I believe. (Nitpick) Amazon could have really saved the huge box they shipped the tool in as it was big enough to fit a small table or furniture. It was packaged well with the ""de-weeding"" part completely attached to the product information card so as to protect it from being damaged and it from damaging anything. The tool is built quite well with only the ""pinching"" mechanism the only thing movable in the entire assembly. Initially, I thought it was really not working but realized I was using it incorrectly. Once I read and followed the instructions carefully, it turned out to be a breeze. You spot the weed, in most cases dandelion, position the two forks (equalling four prongs) so that the weed is right smack in the middle of the prongs, press with the footpad lever with your feet, release your foot, then lean the handle sideways downwards towards where the direction of where the footpad lever is.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c3d;RXV9TC4U055FG;;2018-02-16;TRUE;B01LYNW421;5.0;"OK, let's clear up a few things: 1) I am a real buyer, was not given this pillow, was not paid to review this pillow. There's no way I'm doing any of that. 2) I want everyone to know exactly what I'm giving an opinion on. This ""Beckham Hotel"" pillow is the very same as others called ""Sleep Restoration Super Plush Gel-Fiber Filled Pillows"". That's what the package the two pillows (costing $35 total) came in reads, and there's a small bar-coded sticker with tiny writing indicating the Beckham Hotel re-branding. 3) There's NO smell. There's NO mildew. They arrived factory clean and shipped in a nice, zipped plastic container bag. 4) They arrive dead flat. When you remove them, they start to fluff up. I'd say after an hour or so they are ready to use. Fluff them a bit, and you can sleep on them right away. It's not necessary to put them in a dryer and in fact it could be detrimental. Not sure. 5) I waited a month to write this because I wanted to be sure I liked the pillows. I do! 6) I had some doubts at first because I thought they'd be too soft, but after a couple of nights I would now describe them as soft, yet firm enough to support my head and neck correctly. I start out sleeping on my side and of course, at some point end up on my back, and then often back on my side. 7) They're heavy enough to no move around, but not heavy like a (solid) memory foam pillow is. They stay put in other words. 8) I purchased the queen sized ones. Now, it was sort of interesting to me that these are 20 inches wide, and yet a queen size pillowcase is also 20 inches wide. Yet, a pillow is quite high and a pillowcase is of course - flat. This means it requires some effort to squeeze the pillow into the pillowcase. BUT, perhaps this makes the pillow seem a bit firmer than my initial impression of it was in paragraph #6. At any rate, it works and these have worked out well for me. 9) I woke up in a hotel about 4 years ago with neck pain and had it ever since. All sorts of chiropractic efforts, daily neck stretches, painkillers, etc. just didn't seem to get rid of it. I ditched my Tempur-Pedic s-shaped solid memory foam pillow and tried several other pillows I got locally. They all went back. I got these pillows, continued on the daily neck stretches and now I'm feeling fine with no more neck pain. I noticed about a week ago I was waking up with no more neck pain. That's a relief. That's about all I can tell you Amazon shoppers. Buying a pillow is a wilderness of choice. I spent a LOT of hours on here looking. And of course pillows, and the comfort of them, is very personal and subjective. I can only say, for me, these worked out. If they don't for you, I assume you can return them, possibly with some shipping cost. I don't know. I'm not a regular Amazon customer and not a Prime member.

I've tried expensive memory foam and temperpedic pillows and they are always too hard even though your head ""sinks "" in. I just want alot of fluff but not feel like the pillow flattens 2 weeks later. It's been 3 months so far and the pillow STILL retains it's shape and original height. I co sleep with my 2 year old and the pillows always have a lot of body weight on them and constant movement, but they still support and hold !!! That awkward gap between your neck and the bed is filled with this pillow because it maintains it's height and fluff and doesn't sink down too much. I always make sure before bed I obsessively HAVE to grab this pillow and I put them in special pillow cases so I always know where they are on the bed and which to grab. I thought the price was decent considering you get 2 good pillows. Cons: a possible con is if someone doesn't like this style of pillow. Everyone is different and needs something different from their pillow. If you are the kind of person who likes that memory foam /temperpedic pillows, then this pillow probably isn't for you. If youre someone always trying to layer super soft pillows up under your head, because you like the softness but also need the support - this pillow may work for you. I would say this is on the SOFT side for pillows - not for those who don't want their heads to sink in. However, because the softness is layered up so high and has a great width/THICKNESS, your head and neck gap will also feel supported. If you don't want a puffy/high pillow, and prefer flatter thinner ones - this probably isn't for you. ! These pillows were def. A hit for me! And I noticed much better sleep even just after the first night. I have to be raised higher to sleep now because my son sleeps better when I'm boosted up at an incline. I was so tired of stacking a million pillows that didn't feel that soft anyway. This takes care of that problem ! I gave 4 stars because a product can always be improved. I never do 5 stars unless a product is the most perfect it could ever be. Plus, like I said, the quality will be objective as what works for one person in a pillow may not work for another.

Use the unit conversion function to switch between units as needed. Simply press the ""Unit"" button to cycle through the available units.

It helps me measure food and ensure the quality control on everything. This food scale is my constant companion. I don‚Äôt eat without it. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I didn't always use a food scale to measure my food intake. In fact, for years when I heard people talk about using a food scale, and measuring their food intake it was always dieters, and one thing I never went on was a diet. At least not in the sense I understood they meant to use the word, ""diet""! The thought of depriving my body from food was foreign to me. In fact, growing up with a limited food supply meant that once I was old enough to get a job, I exiled food shortage from my life. However, overeating because food became plentiful in adulthood with a job eventually became a problem. Especially after pregnancy and becoming a mother. An experience worth losing a few vanity points over for sure! However, with weight gain vanity concerns pale in comparison to health concerns. You see, I needed to know for sure that I was eating what my body needed, and that I was feeding my husband and children what their bodies needed. And, if I began to tip over to overeating, I wanted it to be a conscious choice! And for my husband and children, I wanted to help them learn when to recognize that they were tipping over the point of eating the recommended daily calories from each food group so that I and so that they had awareness of when they had enough to do the job of sustaining a thriving body so we could experience the whole life change we were after as a family. This Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale plays a big part of helping us do that. All day, every day. It makes it easy. It takes just a second to put the food on it and measure the serving size. And I get to choose the units (ounces, grams, etc.). Now, I don't know about you, but I LOVE observing how people who work for companies in a support capacity do their jobs. And when I come across a person or staff that wows me, I stop and take notice! I also stop and take notice when I come across staff that has the opposite effect on me. And my follow through is just as thorough then as this review is now. The Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale support team wowed me! Immediately they responded to my inquiry when my scale, which I had for a long time, stopped working one day. Like I told you, this thing works hard all day every day measuring food for a family of four. Well, their support team instructed me on how to troubleshoot what was the cause of the problem, offered to send me a new scale, which arrived quickly, AND the piece de resistance. Several weeks later, they reached out to me to ask me how the new scale was working. Talk about a customer support team! Now that's the kind of service I want all day every day! So, if you're considering buying a food scale for yourself and/or your family, I highly recommend the Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale. Not just because it's an amazing digital piece of machinery, but because the company has people, actual human beings who work there that care about the service they provide customers and it shows in the CRM (customer relationship management) system they very likely automated utilizing the beauty of digital technology to do it, but they also kept the human element present with their service, which gives them an extra edge. This is my third Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale! It's a machine. It isn't meant to last forever. All machines eventually stop working. There's an expected life for every machine. And when this machine serves me till it can't anymore, like the last 2 did, I'll gratefully whisper a thank you for your service to the people who made it and gladly buy another one. Year after year. Etekcity and their customer team now have a ""raving fan"", as one of my favorite teachers and mentors calls it!

I pulled the pillows out of their vaccum sealed bags. I had pulled them from the front and back of the pillows to seperate the fluff a little to fluff the pillows up some more. I then threw them into the dryer for 10 minutes. Thats it just 10, doubt longer would hurt it but just how long I put them in there. The pillows fluffed up so much more that way and feel amazing. They are very soft but still supportive. They don't just go flat after laying on them. I see so many pictures and comments saying how flat the pillows are or how they aren't as fluffy as expected.. do this trick throw them in the dryer for a short time and they will feel so different and be so fluffy. I measured how wide the pillows ended up being after the dryer and it was about 8 to 9 inches! Throw them in the dryer and still get to use then in 10 to 15 minutes! The pillows after taking them out of the vaccum sealed bag were like most of the photos on these reviews. After hand fluffing them it was pretty good but felt like it would still go flat. After the dryer they looked like the pictures in my review. Truly amazing! These are 20√ó20 btw.

I have purchased these before and I love them because they keep me comfy all night long and that's not easy to do these days. I hate to say it, but the older I get, the more difficult it is to get that comfort, especially in the tropics. I understand that in the cold northern climates you would choose the higher thread count for warmth and they tend to 'wear like iron'. But in the tropics, I prefer a light weight sheet and therefore a smaller thread count, but with microfiber there doesn't seem to be any thread count. Anyway, these are light weight, fairly no-iron and so far, I haven't ripped them despite having an adjustable bed where I tend to pull the top of the fitted sheet way down below the base of the adjustable platform as it pulls on the sheet when it flattens out! Also, I always buy 2 of everything and the colored Twin XL sheets I have purchased have to come with 2 pillow cases, but not the white sets.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c42;R2Y4EU7FA1AAJD;;2023-02-12;TRUE;B07TL6PNLH;5.0;"I've been eating super healthy for the past 2 years but THIS year decided to really buckle down, lose weight, gain muscle, get energy, feel good, be happy. I'm doing a lot of clean eating, cardio, strength training and rucking. I love protein shakes because they are a nice way to get in some protein, taste good and are EASY to make. My problem is is that I wake up super early and my blender, albeit awesome, is LOUD AS HECK. Instead of waking the dead, I decided to get a shaker cup. 1- Size: This might be too small for some people. Originally I was doing 2 cups of almond milk, spinach, carrots, raspberries, orgain, MCT oil, matcha and chlorophyll. While super duper healthy, I wanted to stop drinking my calories and do one cup of almond milk. I cut everything and ended up with chlorophyll, orgain and ONE cup of almond milk. That makes this size of a shaker perfect for me. Even if I decided to do 2cups of milk, this would still be a good size. 2- PRICE: To be 100% transparent, there is TWO (maybe more) listings for this specific shaker/brand. I orignally purchased the one that is $1.20 cheaper in a color I didn't really LOVE and just LIKED. I realized about 30 seconds later (I'm working on my ADHD lol) that THIS listing had MORE colors and colors I LOVED, was $1.20 MORE and came with the metal thingy, so I cancelled the other one and got this one. Price is good. $1.20 more for a metal thingy is nice and I love the color I bought. 3- Color: The FIRST one I got was like Teal. Cool. It's blue, I love blue. BUT, I love this blue better baby :o) This is navy blue, true to color, kinda dark, I love it a lot. 4- Leak Proof: I mean I work from home, workout at home, eat at home. I am not a gym rat. Maybe eventually I will venture outwards among the peoples but for now I am in my house. I DON'T know if this is 100% leakproof. Here is what I do know: - The ""drink part"" has that plastic part that comes down and CLICKS so you can HEAR it locking properly. I use the term ""locking"" loosely. But it is a nice tight close. I still kept my finger on it because I have trust issues from other cups lol. But, I shook it a lot and it stayed closed. - It's a fatty and a shorty. Fat and short cups = stability. Overall it was under $10, I love the color and size, it can go in the dishwasher (top rack, dude) and it's a thick plastic. Tip: For my new shaker peoples: Don't shake and drink. If you're using protein powder, go do something else for a few minutes. When i use the blender with orgain it has more RPM than my arm so it blends everything PERFECT. I can make it, blend it, drink it. With this shaker I let it sit for 2-5 min and those little pieces should dissolve and make it not so ""grainy"" for lack of a better term.";I Love It!;real;real;B07TL6PNLH;28;Home & Kitchen;BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle Perfect for Protein Shakes and Pre Workout, 20-Ounce, Clear/Black;89565;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:28:32.559

Before I got the bright idea to purchase this item, I was drinking down water bottles to a specific spot then funneling the workout powder in then shaking it‚Ä¶ not smart, kind of messy, inefficient and wasteful. The BlenderBottle has a measuring line on the side of the cup that allows me to put in the right amount of water, then I can just dump in my pre workout mix then blend it using the spring ball. When I‚Äôm done I can rinse it out before cleaning it pretty easily. There is one small issue though‚Ä¶ this could just be my product‚Ä¶but the lid doesn‚Äôt stay shut. Not the twist portion but the spout lid. When I try to close the spout, it pops back up and doesn‚Äôt seal. I‚Äôve tried lifting up and putting down the clip and that didn‚Äôt affect the spout lids ability to stay shut without me manually holding it shut. It‚Äôs not a major problem for me.

There are a lot of little things about this bottle that you start to notice: - The wire ball is a great idea and does a fantastic job of mixing. It's light years ahead of putting a spoon in a glass and stirring. - The bottom of the cup is spherical to match the mixing ball so that it doesn't leave any unmixed portion. - The spout hinge closes very tightly to prevent leaks, but there is a large ledge for your thumbs to grasp from underneath to pop it open it easily. - The spout hinge has enough friction to stay open without flapping around, so it doesn't hit you in the cheek when you drink from the spout. - The sides have indents that act as reliefs to add grip so that when you screw down the lid, you have something to hold onto, ensuring that it closes tightly with no leaks. - The edges of the pour spot are nicely rounded off so they feel comfortable on the lips, and the diameter is just right for drinking -- if you want to chug your drink quickly, there's enough room for air to get past to prevent restrictions, but you can also sip comfortably. - The mouth of the bottle with the lid removed is quite wide, and very convenient for dumping drink mix or other ingredients without missing and making a mess. - There's a convenient folding loop for carrying the bottle with one finger if your hands are full. - It's just the right size, not tiny and not gigantic. The only minor annoyance that I experienced was that I tended to get the wire mixing ball stuck on things when setting it out to dry (such as the wire sides of a dish drying rack.) That's easy enough to work around.

I love the minimalist look and color of that bottle. It's pretty banged up now, and still looks cool. My only complaint is that the nozzle has gotten pretty loud lately when I sip it, so there's no way to drink silently at this point. I am someone who always has a water bottle with me, and I'm particular about user experience with water bottle design. There's just too much out there to not be. I love this Owala bottle right off the bat. Glad I found it in all white too. The 32oz just barely tucks into the cup holder in my car, which is great. I like how the ""lock"" loop doubles as handle, because I often carry my bottle by hand on walks and at work. We'll see how long the hinge lasts. It seems pretty beefy, but a 32oz insulated metal bottle full of water swinging around should take a toll after a while. For a bottle that's too large to fit in most cup holders, its probably going to be on it's side and tumbling around more than a smaller one, so having a way to secure it closed makes sense as a feature. I also love the size of the opening, and straw/chug design. Unlike the straw on a Hydroflask, it's very easy to sip from this one and get a LOT of water quickly with minimal effort. I HATE the big mouth opening of most bottles. It's so weird to me that the ""big mouth"" feature is branded as a feature. It's just annoying. I can chug the entire bottle fast, if I want, with no risk of spilling the water on my face with the Owala design. This is simple, but I like the shape of the bottle. I dont like when brands try to get cute with contouring the bottle shape, or fluting the neck (which only makes the water stream more chaotic when you tip to drink). Having a uniform shape is just more practical for drinking from and storing the bottle. My only [potential] complaints: 1. The ""lock"" loop is something I find myself constantly messing with, and always have to make sure it's pushed out of the way when I go to sip the bottle. Minor complaint, but it does force me to use 2 hands in situations where I didnt previously have to with my Kinto. In 90% of my use cases, I find myself wishing the bottle had a static finger loop mounted behind the spout that would stay out of the way. I think I would prefer giving up the locking feature for this. 2. The hinge of the lock loops also feels like something that will become a weak point and eventually break or swivel loosely, and make the experience of using the bottle worse. The divot around the spout where it tucks also makes cleaning the bottle more complicated--again, another reason the bottle would be improved by excluding it. 3. The bottom that flips the cap open to drink is pretty stiff and hard to press if you arent hitting it at the perfect angle. I'm sure this is a good thing for avoiding unwanted opening/spilling, but has made using the bottle a little uncomfortable. Maybe it'll break in over time. 4. The rubberized surface around the spout seems to smudge and stain easily, and it's hard to wipe stuff off of it. Not sure if there's any practical design purpose to that section being rubberized. If there is, I haven't noticed one.";Still deciding...;real;real;B085DV8T75;29;Home & Kitchen;Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw for Sports and Travel, BPA-Free, 24-oz, Shy Marshmallow;15565;4.8;10;2023-04-29 08:28:40.315

It is hands down the best water bottle I've ever owned, and I've tried a wide variety of them. The beautiful design of this water bottle is one of its standout features. The sleek, modern look not only makes it visually appealing but also extremely functional. The straw and the spout offer two different drinking options, making it versatile and convenient for various situations, whether you're on the go, at the gym, or just enjoying some leisure time. One significant advantage of this water bottle is that it genuinely encourages me to drink more water throughout the day. The ease of use and convenience of the straw make it simple to stay hydrated without any hassle. Plus, the insulation ensures that my water stays cold for an extended period, which is perfect for long days and hot weather. The only potential concern is whether or not the Owala FreeSip is dishwasher safe. I haven't been able to confirm this, but it's possible that it is safe for dishwasher cleaning. Regardless, it's worth noting that the bottle is easy to clean by hand, so it's not a major issue. In conclusion, the Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw is an exceptional product for anyone looking to stay hydrated in style. Its beautiful design, functionality, and ability to encourage increased water consumption make it a must-have.

You can alternate if you like without ever having to disconnect or reconnect any pieces! It's amazing! The people who designed this bottle did so with the human mouth in mind. I can't even describe how it fits my mouth perfectly. I recommended this to someone in a Facebook group by saying ""It feels so good on my mouth!"" and she made fun of me--because who would pass up that golden opportunity--but had to go buy one to see what I meant and she replied the next day ""Lindsey is right! It feels so good on my mouth!"" It doesn't leak at all! It also happens to keep my water cold for almost 24 hours. I put ice in it at 10am and still had small ice cubes in it at almost 10am the next morning. I can put cold (but not ice) water in it from the water cooler at 3:30pm, when I'm leaving work and the water in it is still cold when I'm going to bed that night. It's literally the perfect water bottle. My only caveat--and it is such a silly thing--is that because of the shape of it, which fits perfectly in your hand, and because the texture consists of really small dimples, it is harder to get some thicker stickers to stick to it. Some will, but I've had a few that sadly did not stick very well. So, if you like stickers, avoid the really thick ones. That's it! That's the only negative thing!

The mouth on the actual bottle is very wide, so there was no issue getting ice into the bottle straight from the ice dispenser on my refrigerator (the old bottle had a narrow mouth and the ice had to go in one piece at a time). I also wasn't sure I'd like the Chug/Sip feature, but I actually love it. It is nice to have the option on one bottle without changing lids.

Only downside is the bottle capacity is smaller than what i had before. This is the biggest of this design i could find. If you fill the bottle make sure you have the cap open when you put it on, otherwise the pressure will go up and your drink will shoot out of the straw when you open the cap.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c44;R2W2FV2AZITK1;;2019-07-30;TRUE;B018YLFJX4;4.0;"I was looking for storage units to create a pantry but everything I found was not the right size or if it was, the shelves were not adjustable. I found this unit and I loved the amount of weight each shelf held but I wanted the shelves to be closer together and I needed 8-10 shelves total. I searched all over the web to see if I can get extra shelves for this unit but didn't find any, so I decided to get 2 units and use whatever shelves I needed for one unit. I figured that most likely I would've paid more than $50 for 3-5 extra shelves, so for $100 I ended up making one awesome pantry. I used just 8 shelves and stored away 2 shelves and remaining poles. (NOTE: each leg is made out of 2 poles that gets screwed on top of each other so you can actually create 2 shorter units out of one unit) The unit is pretty sturdy but it's a pain in the but to put together by one person. The shelves are held up in place by some plastic pieces that you have to connect and snap together in each corner and then lower the shelf from above on these pieces. The plastic pieces are marked with an arrow and the word TOP. Each pole has markings/indentations 1 inch apart all the way down. You hold 2 plastic piece together and place them around a pole, arrows pointing up, holding them together ABOVE the line on the pole where you want the shelf to end up. Holding the 2 pieces together and by sliding them down they end up in the indention on the pole at the level you want them to be. When they end up on the indention you'll hear a click and that's how you'll know they are locked together in the right place. Count to see on which indention you are on that pole and place the other pieces at the same level on the other 3 poles. Now, 2 things you have to know about these plastic pieces: 1. They would not close together fully, meaning you might see a bit of a space between them. 2. They stay put but when you lower the shelf you will have to hold each one in place and guide each corner of shelf's hole over them because if you don't do that and you hit one of pieces with the shelf they would snap open and you'll have to remove the shelf and connect the piece that disconnected from the pole. It would've been better if the plastic pieces were open only in one side and closing fully when snapped together. What I ended up doing was placing a piece of tape on one side of the plastic pieces (making one side like a door hinge) which made it easier for me to put the shelves over them. If I was hitting one corner by mistake the pieces would not snap off and fall down completely but stay on the pole giving me a chance to close them pretty quickly without having to remove the shelf anymore. At first I put tape all the way around the pieces but the tape was adding thickness to the pieces and they wouldn't fit in the shelves' holes. So, I tried tape only on one side and that worked. After all shelf's corners are places over the pieces, you will have to push down on the shelf, at the same time on all 4 corners to lock the shelf in place evenly. So, with all that said, the units are pretty nice. The plastic pieces need some design improvement. If they were designed better this unit would've been a breeze to put together. One thing I have to mention. I had room for a 46"" or 48"" W unit but that size unit was too deep for my space (I needed 12""-14""D unit and the 48""W they sell on Amazon is 18""-20""D). So I ended up buy this 36"" W unit even though I was not using 10-12 inches of my space where I was planning to place the pantry. I made plans how to arrange baskets on each shelf based on the listed measurements. A lot of planning went into this since I had to consider how many baskets I needed and how much that would cost, finding the right size baskets etc, etc. Only after I ensemble the entire unit I found out that the 3 baskets I initially wanted to place side by side on each shelf would not fit and I was baffled not knowing why that would be.... Well, the unit is 36"" W, meaning the shelves are 36"" W but because the ploles are designed to be part of the shelves they take up about 3"" of the shelf. From one pole to the other you have 33"" width and because of that I couldn't use the baskets I needed to use and had to rethink the entire pantry, cost, sizes of items etc. Because of this unforeseen issue I lost a bit of space in the spot where I placed the unit (keep in mind that I could've used a much wider shelving unit to begin with) and I'm bumped about not using the space to the max as initially intended. I wish I knew about these details about the measurements before I made my decision to purchase this unit. The measurements were a very important part of my decision to purchase these units and they were not an easy item to ensemble and dissemble to send back to Amazon. Although my pantry turn up nice, I had a lot of headaches rearrange everything just because of the unknown measurements. After founding out that the shelves were not as wide as I expected them to be, I couldn't find baskets to fit so I ended up using Flat Rate shipping boxes from USPS (which are free, you can order them online or pick them up at a local USPS location) that I had to cut to size and covered in shelf/drawer lining. Not fun at all :( I would recommend this unit for it's sturdiness and price but buyer beware: you will have to spend some time putting it together if you don't have a 2nd person to help you. And, I hope you read my review if you're planning to use the the unit in a specific way where the exact measurements are a must to know before hand. I finished my pantry by covering the back and sides with a stiff plastic shower curtain, and with a fabric shower curtain for the front part. Another thing I need to mention is that if you need to slide something on the shelf back and forth (like I wanted, a box to be pulled out and put back) the shelf's front is a bit higher and the item on the shelf will sit a bit lower and the edge will have a bit of a ""lip"" so you'll have to lift the item up a little at the edge to get the item over the ""lip"". I didn't like that, so in order to make the shelf smooth front to back, I came up with the idea to put cardboard on the shelf but a bit smaller than the shelf so the thickness of the cardboard when sitting on the shelf away from ""lip"" will come up at the same height with the lip, thus making the shelf same level from front to back. I needed 8 cardboard pieces long enough and very inexpensive. I bought 2 moving boxes 18""x18""x16"" from Menards ( about $5 with tax for both) and cut them lengthwise in 8 pieces. They were the perfect fit. To make sure the cardboard didn't move when pulling my boxes out, I taped the cardboard in each corner from underneath. Problem solved and it came out nice. I hope all this info might help someone who wants to use this unit for a pantry. Pictures: 1. How the unit looks with the cardboard on each shelf 2. Work in progress, how the flat rate boxes look after I cut them to the size I needed to be 3. How the unit looks from the back with the plastic shower curtain covering the back and sides 4. How everything looks and how the unit looks like with 8 shelves on it 5. I ended up finding some baskets that were perfect fit and blended well with the flat rate boxes. I didn't like the baskets' colors much but I had no choice, I made them work :) 6. How the flat rate boxes looked like after covering them in shelf/drawer lining I got at Dollar Tree store and label them too :) Also, on the shelf with the 2 green baskets, in the back of the shelf I used a lazy susan I had before to be able to easily access my tomato paste cans. 7. Final product. Front covered with fabric shower curtain that's easy to pull up to one side (see picture #4 to see how it seats on left upper corner). On top of the unit I places 3 foldable rectangular boxes (from Menards $6 ea) that I'll use for very light items (toilet paper, paper towels, napkins etc). To make sure all weight is distributed ok and unit stays in place first I made sure feet were leveled properly (the unit had screws at the bottom of each foot so you screw and unscrew each feet to level it properly to an uneven floor). Second, I secured the unit with velcro and plastic cable ties to the railing thats on the back of the unit (the unit comes with ties to secure it to walls but I used my own ties) Third, I placed my heavy items on the lower shelves (cans, sugar, flour, oil etc). And lastly, I placed my light items (mixed in with some light weight ones) on the upper shelves and the top one. 8. I needed more light so I found this light that has a magnet on the bottom and a hook to hang anywhere. I can move it on any shelf, (standing up, sideways, etc) and have my hands free when I pull out a box/basket etc. It's awesome.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c44;R39DBM0P75BXVJ;;2023-04-24;TRUE;B018YLFJX4;4.0;I wound up buying eight of these shelf units because of a need for some substantial garage organization and am very glad I did so. These may not at quite the quality level as a bunch of somewhat larger and taller units that will hold more weight, but those are substantially more expensive, come with a whopping delivery charge, and no free returns. If the size will suit you, these shelves hold plenty of weight (unless you plan to store engine blocks on them or maybe your gold bullion collection), are quite sturdy, and are decently crafted. Remember that I bought eight and did not find more than relatively minor issues with any of them. Here are some specifics‚Äî PARTS: All eight had every last part they were supposed to have, and all parts were turned out with decent accuracy (no twisted shelves, no warped uprights, etc.). Suggestion: Don't get rid of little parts you don't use, because you never know what may come up. There's a stabilize-unit-to-wall kit with each unit in case you decide to line them up against a wall rather than have them free-standing, as I'm doing. If I change my mind, I still have eight kits. I'm also using casters, but I've saved the feet for each unit. Finally, each unit comes with an extra shelf corner attachment pair so that there are 21 rather than 20 per unit. Who knows when it might be crucial to have an extra? (I keep all of this stuff in a little bag hanging on a hook at the back of one of the units.) ASSEMBLY: The first one took me probably 45 minutes to assemble, but that's because there are three or four handy techniques that make assembly go faster and smoother but require some fiddling around to figure out. The second one was done in maybe half an hour, and the rest were more like 20 minutes apiece. One thing I decided to do is to have the shelves on all eight of the units as close to equally spaced bottom to top as possible, which will work fine for my purposes. Once I got the first unit set up, it was fairly easy to match subsequent ones against that first one to get the shelves the same. USE: Mine are all on casters, and when loaded, they roll easily and smoothly on the garage floor. The wheels are not mounted with ball bearings, but it's not as if I'm going to roll these units downtown and back. They easily bear weight up to the limits set forth in the documentation (I experimented to be sure). TWO ISSUES: These are why I've given this product four rather than five stars. ‚úîQuality control at the factory is not what it should be or I would not have received two units with gouges and scrapes in the paintwork that positively did not occur during shipping. Fortunately, these are minor and not immediately noticeable, but they shouldn't have passed inspection. A little appropriate paint will correct this, but I shouldn't have had to do it. ‚úîNo matter how I fuss and tweak with them, three of the shelves in the eight units are not quite level. Most are very close to true level, but these three are not. It isn't enough to cause a problem, but the degree of departure from level is beyond reasonable limits.;Very Good Value at a Fair Price;real;real;B018YLFJX4;30;Home & Kitchen;Amazon Basics 5-Shelf Adjustable, Heavy Duty Storage Shelving Unit (350 lbs loading capacity per shelf), Steel Organizer Wire Rack, Black (36L x 14W x 72H);211277;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:28:47.805

Be aware this isn't exactly 36L x 14W - They rounded it up to a whole number. I mainly got this because I like these kinds of shelves for my fish tanks and the original one I got was more expensive than when I got it a few years ago (have a Honey Can Do 36"" x 16"" shelf). This was option 2. When it came, everything was loose in the bag, the plastic cover pieces for the bars were all broken and unusable but I didn't end up using them so they got tossed. When it was assembled, I noticed it makes this thumping sound when you move it slightly so been a bit wary of that. One of the welds on the bottom shelf had broke so I ended up using another shelf to this unit. Once the tanks were on, I noticed the top one seems to droop slightly and that's made me a bit wary since it said it would hold several hundred pounds. The top tanks are 2 5 gallons and maybe weigh 50-60 pounds each when filled with all the supplies, so I ordered a wooden shelf to go below it for support which I now need to cut because it's not the right size...

Just take your time and the plastic clips won't fall off. The shelf when assembled was really high quality. The casters added nice flexibility as I was moving items from an existing shelf to this new one (which combined two smaller units into one) and this value cannot be overstated. I had to do much less carrying from one shelf to this one. I just brought the new shelf over and relocated the items and when the old ones were empty, I removed the old shelf units and rolled the new one in place. I do plan on buying another.

The plastic sleeves that press onto the poles to support the shelves do not snap together, but are on opposite sides and stay in place with a ridge that fits snugly against the pole. When you ease the shelf down the poles, each corner slides down onto the pair of sleeves on each pole. The sleeves are tapered at the top and wider at the bottom so the shelf cannot slide past the sleeve. Tap each shelf with a small hammer to seat it. The 16 round discs that are left after assembly, were included simply to keep the shelves separated during shipping , and are supposed to be discarded.

Because I will eventually need to move these if I were to ever get work done on the pipes or the furnace and air conditioner lines leading to outside, I plan to replace these shelves with ones having wheels. These however will be going into the garage along with about 9 more of these I plan to use along the walls to organize the garage. The shorter shelves can easily be put together by one person. The taller 5 shelf could be put together by one person but probably should be put together by two people. I am a shorty with stubby arms, and for me, it would have been difficult to do this alone. But with my friend, it only took about 10 minutes for each shelf after we figured out how to do it. I have seen less sturdy shelves that cost much more than these. After looking around at other shelves, I think these are good for the price. Especially if using as a pantry shelf, I would recommend shelf liners.

I was eating that soup by the time it would have normally taken to chop all those ingredients by hand. The apple and onion were simply cut in half and placed flat side down. For carrots, cut each carrot down to the approximate size of the chopping plate and then slice in half (flat side down). Don‚Äôt overload the tray with too many carrots and wham-o‚Ä¶chopped carrots.

The other chopper handle was easy to press plus it had a button that pushed the rubber pusher nubs outward, which made it easy to clean. I just ran the unit under the faucet. The old chopper would cut anything, including meat for making chicken, ham, or egg salad. When I saw the picture of this model, the black area on the top looked like it would push the rubber nubs out. Wrong. It's just a decoration. The reviews said this chopper cut well. Sadly, the chopper does not live up to the claims. I have LOTS of experience using a chopper, so I know what I am doing. This chopper was a nightmare the first time I used it. I started with onions. I had to STEP on the handle to get it to cut. Forget cooked chicken. All of the items I needed chopped caught in the rubber nubs. It's a good thing the box contains cleaning implements because I NEEDED THEM. It took so much time cleaning out the rubber pusher, I could have hand chopped the meat and vegetables and had a nap afterward. I'm not going to return the item because it's too much trouble.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c47;RWVZOZX109RU3;;2023-03-05;TRUE;B001EYHAGS;4.0;For years, there have been spots around my place that have haunted me, and no matter how hard I endlessy scrubbed with various types of cleaning equipment and solvents, they just laughed at me and remained. 30 seconds with this steam cleaner and suddenly they disappeared. It truly IS worth the money! However, that being said, there are a few flaws with this particular model that I wish I knew and realized before using it. The first of which is that it really requires three hands to use properly with anything that is not firmly planted in place, one to hold the nozzle extender, one to hold the device and push the button, and a third to hold the object being cleaned. I suppose I COULD simply use a different extension to combine the first two hands, but it is rather awkward to do so. The second issue is that it's almost too effective with the brushes in removing worn in gunk, and they last far too short a time before they go from cleaning to simply pushing the gunk around. Now I've taken to removing those brushes and running them through a dishwasher cycle to clean them, but believe me, this limits the amount of time in any given session that you can spend focusing on the cleaning, and if you're just starting out using one of these, believe me, there's a LOT of work needed on the first pass as years of build up being removed just clumps up. And the third thing that I didn't realize was that the amount of water you can use dissipates rather quickly because it is so compact, and refilling it does take a little time as you have to wait for the inner chamber to cool enough so it doesn't flash boil as soon as you attempt to refill it, further extending the amout of time it takes in a single session to use. So, while it DOES do exactly what it says it does probably better than you might think, you should really think about addressing the above issues with another, larger model. But again, although this review seems to focus on the flaws, that should be seenonly as being nitpicky. Overall, I am ecstatic with the purchase and am looking forward to addressing all of those little things that have been bugging me around my place.;A Revelation To Me!;real;real;B001EYHAGS;33;Home & Kitchen;BISSELL SteamShot Deluxe Hard Surface Steam Cleaner with Natural Sanitization, Multi-Surface Tools Included to Remove Dirt, Grime, Grease, and More, 39N7A;24044;4.3;10;2023-04-29 08:29:10.649

Once the steam got hot enough, you could literally see it melting the grime off of the grout. First picture has only a few grout lines that I had cleaned.

The problem comes after you use it for a couple of minutes then the machine has to ‚Äúshut down‚Äù to allow steam to build back up again in order to continue doing the job. The red light on the side comes on indicating a wait period while it builds up steam again. It‚Äôs not empty and it doesn‚Äôt turn off but it doesn‚Äôt continue producing steam until it has had another couple of minutes to re-pressurize and re-heat back up.

Everyone in our group were miserable as no air circulation and in October they turned off the a/c AND NO FANS! My 2nd trip I brought this little guy along with me. A friend gave me a nice mini boxed fan (5x6) but it was really heavy and I wanted to travel light. The fan works when walking, in a hotel room. I put it by my bedside and it was awesome. DOWNSIDE it is not well balanced so it falls over easily and it does fall over if you touch it. The tiny fan will stop without harm if you accidentally touch it when reaching for say the light or your phone etc. on the table but it will start back up. The tiny flashlight is great. BUT I did have it plugged into a charger the size/weight of an iphone 8 through the night as the charge would not last all night. You really need the charger which worked great for recharging the fan, my nebulizer and iphone.

Figured this might help, and if it didn't. Well ill just return it. Nope. I knew about the light, and the fact its chargeable. As well as the electronic charging capabilities. Was not expecting 2 different speeds. Truth, i didnt read the full description, but i didnt buy this for the flaslights or phone charging abilities. Bought this solely for the fan. So the speed option was a fabulous surprise. Flashlight is pretty bright. Easy enough to open and adjust. Just got this in the mail and so its too soon to describe how fantastic or horrid this purchase was. As of this moment all i can assure is the fact this item initially functions as described. Didn't see an instruction manual included, but to be fair its about 11pm right now with the lights off reviewing this fan while blind (eye glasses broke).

I got it to make waffles for my 3 year old son and the size is perfect for him. They‚Äôre pretty small (about the size of an Eggo).

It‚Äôs very easy to use and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with sticking yet and I‚Äôve made about 20 waffles. My only complaints are: 1) the indicator light is blue and not very bright, so if there‚Äôs a lot of light in your kitchen you have to put your hand over it to see if the light is on or off to know if it‚Äôs ready yet. 2) the waffles do not cook evenly. The top browns way faster than the bottom. So one side is nice and crispy but the other side is still soft. This doesn‚Äôt bother me too much as they‚Äôre mostly for a toddler and most of them get reheated in a toaster so it doesn‚Äôt matter. Overall I think it‚Äôs worth it for the price.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c4d;R1Q8BW4JXZ9ULA;;2020-05-22;TRUE;B01M9I779L;5.0;"There are few items on Amazon for under $10 that are as fantastic as this mini waffle maker. My Wife and I absolutely love it, as does our Little Girl. And what's not to love about it? It makes perfect Eggo-sized waffles, in record time. I do have a few quick suggestions for anyone that's interested in getting it, as well as one terrific hack for using this waffle maker that will be a real game-changer for breakfast and desserts. First off, how to use it.... We use Krusteaz Belgian waffle mix, although just about any waffle or pancake mix will do. We recently got a KPKitchen batter dispenser for pancakes and waffles, which makes it easier to get just the right amount of batter into the waffle iron each and every time. WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BATTER DISPENSER? Quick pro tip I can offer you. Don't have a fancy measured batter dispenser? Next time you finish off a bottle of ketchup, mustard, squeeze jelly, etc, don't throw away the container. Wash it well. Then when you have your pancake or waffle batter mixed, just remove the top to the squeeze bottle, and pour the batter in. Pop the top back on. And now you've got an easy-squeeze bottle that lets you perfectly pour batter info waffle makers or on a frying pan. Best of all, you don't have to use all of the batter at once. When you're done making waffles, just close the cap, and stick the bottle in the fridge. It will usually stay good for 2-4 days, just don't leave it at room temp for more than two hours at a time. BACK TO MAKING THE WAFFLES.... The easiest way to ""grease"" the waffle maker is to simply do a quick spray of Pam on each hot plate before you start making them. If you want waffles that are soft on the outside, spray between each waffle made. If you like a golden brown, slightly crispy/crunchy texture to your waffles, you only need to use the cooking spray once. Stick to using silicone and similar spatulas (avoid using metal utensils) to remove the waffle when it's finished. What's terrific about the size of this waffle maker is that if you have a leftover waffle or two after eating, you can simply stick them in the fridge or freezer for later, and pop them into your toaster (something you can't do with regular-sized waffle makers). Okay, now to the really cool part.... You can make the most amazing waffles with this thing using just canned cinnamon rolls. Without everyone having to wait forever for cinnamon rolls to be baked in the oven. Get a can of the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing. Now you can use the icing as-is, but you can make it ""pourable"" by adding a few ingredients. Just whisk/stir the included cream cheese icing with a cup of powdered sugar, three tablespoons of milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Once it's smooth, set it aside. When the waffle maker is hot and ready, stick one cinnamon roll directly in the center of it, and close the top firmly. What's going to happen is that it will slowly rise, the top will slowly move up as well. Grab the ""handle"" for the top and firmly press it down a second time. What this does is not only flatten the roll to completely fit the circle of the waffle iron, but ensures that it stays flat and baked through. You can eyeball and it and tell when it's made to your liking, I've found that it takes just slightly longer to make a cinnamon roll waffle than a regular waffle made with batter. Before each waffle is served, drizzle your cream cheese glaze over it. Not only do you have an amazing waffle with a taste like none other, but you don't need any type of pancake or waffle batter on hand. I experimented and also made Pillsbury orange rolls with orange icing, they were fantastic. Just remember, the key to making perfectly round cinnamon roll waffles is to close the lid not once, but a second time as the roll starts to rise in your waffle maker. There are plenty of things you can buy for ten bucks. But instead of spending ten bucks on fast food, or two iced coffees, invest it something that you'll actually use often. And when you order one of these, you'll definitely use it often. Breakfast waffles. Piping hot cinnamon roll waffles topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. Fried chicken and waffle sandwiches. Your only limit is your imagination. You can do what I did, read plenty of reviews, and then decide to order it. Or you could just see for yourself how great it works, it's only $10.

One is that it is true to its name and is MINI-even smaller then the circle one since you lose waffle space bu making it a heart. I made the smallest batch I could and still got about 20 waffles out of it-that‚Äôs a long time to stand in front of the waffle maker-so if you have a larger family this may not work for you. It‚Äôs just my son and I in the mornings so it doesn‚Äôt bother me terribly. The other thing is there is no timer for when it‚Äôs done-you just gotta figure that out yourself.

If you have any carpet or soft surfaces in your home (couches, chairs, etc.), you need this! Our poor dog had bladder stones and had had multiple accidents on our stairs. There isn't much you can do to properly clean that, without renting a commercial carpet vacuum, or hiring a company to do it. The stairs are the only carpeted surface in our home, so I had been putting it off. Finally, I saw this little Bissell vacuum and at an affordable price, so I decided to just take the plunge, and it worked it a miracle on our stairs! It arrived quickly, instructions were thorough, and it's extremely easy to use. Just fill up the water tank and plug it in. Flip the on switch, squeeze the trigger to release water and cleaning solution, let it sit for a couple of minutes, and vacuum up. I wish I had taken before and after pictures because it is like night and day for my carpet. The carpet looks and smells brand new. The disgusting dirty brown water showing all that came out of the carpet was satisfyingly gross. I was so ecstatic with the condition of my carpet that I went on to use it on our dining room chairs. Purchased about 6 months ago, they are a cream color that easily got stained by our kids. Went through the same easy process with the little vacuum, and they basically look brand new in a matter of 30 minutes. I did go over them a few times to get as much water out as possible, and they dried in a few hours. I recommend putting a towel down on your floor when you are spraying the water from the vacuum, as it does have a heavy spray. I also recommend filling up the water tank after you have carried the vacuum up the stairs, as opposed to before, if you're able, as it does add a little extra weight. I love this vacuum and will be using it on our stinky couch next! It's compact and easily stowed, super easy to use, and very affordable!

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c50;R1ZFAZEW7919UD;;2022-07-04;TRUE;B0016HF5GK;5.0;First let me say I don‚Äôt normally take time to write reviews but I just had to share my story because I‚Äôm still giddy about how well this machine worked. I recently purchased a beautiful cream, designer chair at a furniture consignment shop and the lighting must have been bad in the store because I didn‚Äôt notice at all that it was quite dirty. I was just so excited that it was exactly what I had been looking for - color, size, style and price! When I got it home it was perfect in every way EXCEPT the off-white that was so perfect in the fluorescent lighting was a dingy EWWW in the natural light of our living room. I took the armrest covers off and YUCK! I noticed how dirty the arms were and then noticed that I hadn‚Äôt looked that closely on the store - there were spots all over the chair! The store doesn‚Äôt take returns AND I loved everything about the chair except the grime and spots (how did I not notice those in the store???) so I googled best upholstery cleaner and the BISSELL Little Green Machine showed up as top-rated in multiple blogs so I searched for it on Amazon. It had awesome reviews confirming what the blogs has said so I ordered it. It came super-fast and was easy to set up. I got to work. Well, my sweet husband got to work. My plan was to have him handle the task as he‚Äôs usually in charge of the grimy stuff. Love that man. üòäüôè Well I had no idea cleaning upholstery could be so fun! This little machine sucked the grime right out! It was really satisfying to see it get sucked out right before my eyes. Before my husband knew it, he was free to watch his baseball game because I had taken over. When I was finished the cream chair looked like new! And I didn‚Äôt stop there. I had a 14-year old blue chair in my home office that had weathered two babies, lots of journaling and phone conversations with my feet tucked up underneath me, latte spills and just‚Ä¶a full life! Our whole family loves mommy‚Äôs blue chair as it‚Äôs where good conversations and snuggles have happened my kids‚Äô entire lives. When we recently remodeled our home I was looking for a new chair for myself. My whole family protested because they loved it so much. It bummed me out because - well LOOK at the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photos of the blue chair I posted. Our whole house was clean and fresh from the much-needed after 17 years in the house remodel. Having to look at that chair, as much as I loved the memories of it, grossed me out. So when I finished the cream chair I thought, I‚Äôm going to see what the BISSELL Little Green Machine could do for the blue chair. I figured, worst case scenario it would make it worse and then I‚Äôd HAVE to get my new chair. üòÄ I honestly didn‚Äôt think it would make a difference. I had actually had a professional rug + upholstery cleaner look at it and say he couldn‚Äôt do anything to make it look better just two months ago during the remodel. So despite seeing the INCREDIBLE results on the cream chair, my expectations were low. Additionally, this was an inexpensive chair with a sueded microfiber fabric - not nearly as well made as the cream chair so I wasn‚Äôt sure if the not super-sturdy fabric would withstand the cleaning fluid or brush. I was blown away. As you can see by the Before and After photos - the BISSELL mighty little machine did an amazing job!!! The blue chair is saved and we are ALL excited. Yes, even me. üòÉ I just wish I would have taken videos of cleaning the blue chair - the water was SO dirty. GROSS! Again though, it was SO satisfying throughout the process to see the dirt come out and have brand new chairs. This machine is WELL worth the very reasonable price and I also absolutely love being able to restore two chairs rather than buy new ones. Less landfill and consumerism to help the planet. And the pocketbook!!! A little technique scoop (if you‚Äôre still reading) - on the cream chair we sprayed the cleaning water from the machine on the area, then sprayed Resolve and let it sit for a minute or two before we sucked up the dirt. The Resolve did make the dirty water in the tank pretty foamy and I‚Äôm not sure if it could damage the machine or the chair but when we tried it we were kind of thinking we didn‚Äôt have anything to lose as the fabric was so grungy when we got it home to natural light, we would not have kept the chair if the BISSELL didn‚Äôt work. The machine seems totally fine and of course the chair is now clean and beautiful! I could not possibly love this little machine more and now I can feel much more confident with all of our new carpet and furniture because if we get a spill or a stain this lightly little green machine will take care of it!

A few things that I picked up while doing this: - make sure to vacuum REALLY well before you start - spray the solution and let it sit for a minute, then use the brush over the stained area & begin - use more of the solution than just a quick pass over, really soil the area and continue respraying as you go - this sounds obvious, but make sure the clear part is directly on top of the stain, not the brushes (you should see water moving through the head) - don't even bother using the formula it comes with, buy the Bissell Pro Oxy Stain Remover, it works so much better & you have to do way less work - you truly do HAVE to go REALLY slowly; this will be a time-consuming project if you're doing more than spot cleaning - try your best to clean the debris in the clear area as best as you can each use because it can pile up and clog quickly Really easy machine to use and a total life saver!!

It has generously sized clean and dirty water tanks, a nicely long cable, decent suction and a good sprayer. The tanks are also easy to fill and empty. I should have taken before and after photos but I was so excited to shampoo my car I got right into it. The dirty water is from two separate rounds of shampooing. One for my front two rugs and then my two front seats. Even after all that I still have half a tank of clean solution I can use. The brush is okay on the attachment, it‚Äôs soft enough that it‚Äôs not going to damage upholstery, but if you need something with more oopmh I would just grab a stiffer bristled scrub brush and use that after spraying whatever it is your cleaning and then use the attachment brush while suctioning up the water. Remember to always vacuum before shampooing and this machine doesn‚Äôt have heated dry so put a fan on or leave whatever it is you cleaned in an open ventilated space to dry. I hope this little green guy holds up for years to come.;Works great!;real;real;B0016HF5GK;42;Home & Kitchen;BISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner, 1400B;58664;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:30:20.151
644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c50;R3DT259NC8U2S;;2023-04-01;TRUE;B0016HF5GK;5.0;As the mother of a 2.5yo, I have several stains through my home that I've not been able to fully remove by hand. I also just extremely dislike cleaning carpet messes in general. The day this was delivered, I immediately assembled it and went through to clean each one. The tan carpet in this house was new when we moved in 3 years ago, and I have a huge area rug in the living room that I've had for about 7 years, that has seen a lot of life. Whether we're talking explosive diapers from EBFing forever ago, pet messes, food messes, or just foot traffic related messes... Every single stain came up completely! I also have a ginormous desk pad that I adore. A few months ago balsamic vinegar was spilled on it (wish I could blame the toddler lolol!) and I even tried cleaning that just to see what would happen. It came out PERFECTLY! This is my new best friend. The only thing that I would change, is the little attachment for cleaning the carpet. The one that has the brush and everything. It has a clear plastic piece on the top, that you can look through and see the water getting sucked up. I just wish it were removable, so that I could clean the inside of it really well! To be fair, it does tell you to vacuum first. But we ended up having a diarrhea mess on the carpet, and I got up what I could with paper towels. I obviously was not going to vacuum over that, and the bits of lent and whatever else that were already on the carpet, get kinda stuck in the sides of that piece. Doesn't effect how well it works or anything, just makes you wish you could clean it since you can see it!

I highly recommend this machine to anyone who needs a spot cleaned on their carpet or upholstery. It is quick and easy to use, works well, and is easy to clean and put away. It's a great machine.

Guess what happens when everybody comes down with a real bad stomach flu, right after a potluck? Well, I'll spare you the details. As I was contemplating whether I should just burn the house down rather than replace every piece of upholstered furniture, the carpet, and the mattresses... I decided to look into steam cleaners. But renting one was going to be a real pain, so I checked Amazon, and some genius decided to offer this little handheld Bissell for same day delivery. Cause let's face it, when you need one of these things, you probably need it right away. I had my doubts. There was blueberry pie at that potluck. My white couch was now bright purple and smelled like something had died in a cheese factory. But lo and behold, this little machine did the job. My couch is white again. It smells fresh and clean. It was also super easy to assemble, to use and to haul around. I have pretty bad arthritis in my hands, but I didn't have any trouble putting this together or taking it apart. It was also super easy to thoroughly clean all the parts after use, so it doesn't nasty like most wet vacs. The whole cleaning process only took a couple of minutes. Overall, it it just an excellent design. A lot of thought was put into building this. I didn't use the cleaning solution that came with it, I don't like febreze or scented products - but my own favorite cleaning soap worked just fine. I'm now convinced that anyone who has kids, dogs, or who cares for anyone else prone to messes should own one of these things.

It was dark colored and a lot of it, and naturally, the carpet is off white. I used my trusted stain remover (foleys) and the bissell to clean and rinse. It‚Äôs been almost a year and the stain never resurfaced or attracted any other dirt. As this poor Bissell is used almost exclusively for vomit, it‚Äôs still like new. It easy to clean over the tub, and I can rinse out the hose. It dries nicely and after a year of abuse, does not smell at all. I spilled a glass of red wine recently, on a very thick, deep pile area rug, and the bissell cleaned it through to the backing on the rug!!

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c54;R32F3F8TQQWOTO;;2023-04-03;TRUE;B08YDJS51B;5.0;First off, any negative review about being too firm should be taken with a grain of salt, as comfort is subjective. My back needs a very firm bed, so if you are like me, those reviews should be a positive influence. That being said, it IS very firm, yet still conforms to and supports my body, and I am 260 pounds. I say this bed is dangerous because it is VERY easy to fall asleep on, even when you don‚Äôt mean to. And it does keep you cool. I used to wake up sweating around my neck, but not anymore. I usually wake in the same position I fell asleep in. I bought the 10‚Äù version for more support and longevity, and while I‚Äôve only had the bed 3 days, I can tell it was a phenomenal deal. I received it within 6 days, let it breathe for 12 hours, and it is perfect for me. As I lay on it I can feel my back stretching out. In the mornings, I roll over and my back cracks, which I haven‚Äôt been able to do in over a year because my old bed was so worn out that my muscles were tight every morning. I wake feeling refreshed and full of life again, yet I find it difficult to get out of because it‚Äôs like laying on a warm, ultra supportive cloud. I cannot recommend this bed enough if you need lots of support and the cooling factor of the gel. I know it‚Äôs an off brand, but it‚Äôs worth the risk especially at the price (I paid $200 plus $40 shipping). Also, it‚Äôs made in Myanmar, which is the country with the longest running civil war in history, and that explains the long waits some people have complained about. Maybe check out the news on this country before ordering to see what type of turmoil is happening to judge whether or not shipping will take longer. 6 days, $240 for a queen 10‚Äù memory foam/cooling gel mattress is an enormous bargain.

644cb0a6edd6fb90e1883c55;R1TSB9X4O2VTAR;;2023-03-14;TRUE;B01M7WZFAS;4.0;After three attempts at descaling using three different YT videos, reading different comments on ‚Äúhow to.‚Äù I found one that gave exact instructions. It would have been nice if they were included in the solution package! If you‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôm a moron, I will take that. I was just determined to get the descaling light to go off before I used a sharpie to color it in or throw my Keurig in the trash. Trust me, both crossed my mind! HOW TO/COMMENTS: 1. If the descaling solution bottle is meant for two uses, they could just put a mark on the label so you don‚Äôt have to eye ball it, or pay that much attention to what ‚Äúhalf‚Äù is. Yes, I‚Äôm OCD! 2. The 3rd video I watched, during my third attempt, had that you press both the 8 oz & 12 oz buttons when the power is OFF! That sets it in ‚ÄúDescale Mode‚Äù ((One instruction had 8/10, and no one else was clear about pushing the buttons when it was ‚ÄúOFF.‚Äù)) 3. They also said you put half of the descaling solution into the reservoir then just add enough water until the ‚Äúadd water‚Äù light goes off. Make sure you have a bowl or large mug to catch the solution when it comes through the machine. When the add water light goes out, and the ‚ÄúK‚Äù comes on, you just have to press the K, and it will start running the solution through your machine. Keep hitting the K, until the ‚Äúadd water‚Äù light comes on again. Dump the solution water out. 4. They said to rinse the water reservoir (I washed it out - again OCD)! Fill it back up with plain water. The ‚ÄúFill‚Äù light will go out, the ‚ÄúK‚Äù will go on, run all of the water in this cycle through until the add water light comes on again. 5. Repeat Step 4 again (That‚Äôs two cycles of plain water). 6. When it is done, everything will shut off (unless you shorted the water, if it asks for more water, add more water to your reservoir, and finish it off). Then, when it‚Äôs done it should turn completely off. Hold your breath (very important!). When you turn it back on, the descale light should be off. 7. If the descale light is not off, one key I read is to unplug the machine, wait about a minute (I would make it two), then plug it back in again. Between my second and third times of descaling, I did this and moved the Keurig next to the sink (closer to the trash‚Ä¶). I don‚Äôt think that was the key, I think starting off hitting the correct ounce buttons when the machine was turned OFF, allowed it to go into ‚ÄúDescale‚Äù mode, because it operated completely different when that happened. I didn‚Äôt have to lift the lid up/down to press the ‚ÄúK‚Äù to get the water to come out, you just have to press the K and it only takes about 2-3 times for it to completely empty the reservoir. It‚Äôs a relatively fast process if you know what you‚Äôre doing! If none of that works, I would throw it in the trash and start over! Mine was an almost new Keurig and being so smart one day, I decided to clean out the k-cup area, and just try and be all sterile. That‚Äôs when the light came on. Lesson learned! I‚Äôm not sure the descale light ever came on with my previous one, I had it for years. It wasn‚Äôt until Hurricane Ian hit that I needed a new one, so slim trim pretty model. SMH! Go for reliable - LOL! 8. Which goes back to point #1, it would have been SO much easier if the instructions had been included in the descaling solution. After watching so many videos, the only other thing I learned is most people just use vinegar and save a few dollars. The reason for spending more for this product is it has less odor than vinegar. I used it twice in the process of the three cleanings, so a total of one bottle. Imagine a colonic for a Keurig! I‚Äôve got the cleanest coffee machine in town.

I wanted to try it, and I saw this one, and it was reasonably priced, so I only thought twice before purchasing. This steamer would be a good investment for people like me who do their laundry to ensure few wrinkles; however, no matter how hard you try, you will always have a wrinkle here and there. And this steamer is small but works miracles when it comes to those tiny wrinkles. It is travel friendly, easy to store, and compact. I am satisfied with the purchase because I knew it was something other than what I would use daily. There are instances when a minor crease in my clothing makes me lazy about getting out the iron and performing all that extra work. I did not need it for anything significant, in other words. I was excited to try it when it arrived, so I did. At first, I was frightened because there did not appear to be any steam coming out, but after 3 minutes, I saw smoke, so I recommend giving it some time after being plugged in to get it operating. I had never used a steamer before and was highly pleased. It contains enough water to complete at least one outfit. To avoid water spurting out, don't fill it up. Be cautioned not to put your hands or skin too close to the blue nozzle because this machine part gets hot. Despite being portable and simple, I tried a steamer because it doesn't leave wrinkles and lines like an iron. And just as expected, the steam did wonders for me in removing wrinkles. I also used the included brush, which worked equally effectively both ways. Although it works wonders, I would not suggest it to someone who plans to use it frequently because it is time-consuming and doesn't work as well on oversized clothing. This isn't to say that it doesn't work, just that you must review it a few times to get it to look exactly right. However, this is ideal if you're looking for something inexpensive, convenient for storage, and simple to use. Remember that it works best on smaller clothes because it will take less water, and you can get a lot done with one full cup. If you wanted to steam more than one piece of clothing at a time, you would have to stop often, turn the machine off, and let it cool down for a few minutes before adding more water and plugging it back in, and then wait another three minutes for the steam to resume. It has undoubtedly been put to use and has been helpful on numerous occasions. Getting wrinkle-free clothing has become necessary for travel and daily life. The functionality of this product is excellent, given its size and cost. The product heats up quickly and is a perfectly manageable size. Use filtered or purified water to avoid limescale buildup that could damage equipment and stain garments. Although it removes wrinkles rapidly, it cannot replace ironing. The product is excellent overall, and I suggest it unless you plan to use it frequently for formal attire because doing so requires a lot of time. But don't let it deter you from purchasing it. I'm sure you will love it as much as I do and will use it extensively. People like me who take their time with their laundry to ensure minimal wrinkles would benefit from investing in this steamer. Despite our best efforts, there will inevitably be a few wrinkles here and there.";Small but works miracles;real;real;B07HF3X6Y4;48;Home & Kitchen;Hilife Steamer for Clothes, Portable Handheld Design, 240ml Big Capacity, 700W, Strong Penetrating Steam, Removes Wrinkle, for Home, Office and Travel;95240;4.3;10;2023-04-29 08:31:06.045

It was time to get something new and I wanted one that didn‚Äôt take up as much space and I could take with me on vacations. This one had over 90k reviews- mostly positive- so I figured I‚Äôd grab it while it was on sale. It arrived same day, it was simple to ‚Äúput together‚Äù and use immediately. It is very lightweight and I‚Äôd say takes up as much space as a classic blow dryer if I were to pack it in a suitcase/overnight bag. It took a bit to heat up, my larger one had a much bigger water tank and I feel like it took about 30s to heat up. This little guy has like a cup of water in its tank and it probably took closer to a minute to boil the water. Not a big deal just something I noticed. The steam comes out with some force so I was impressed with that-my other steamer just seemed to allow the steam to just float out of the hose attachment. I used this steamer on 2 satin feeling camisoles that where just purchased and taken out of the packaging so they were in pretty bad shape with wrinkles and fold marks. This steamer did a pretty good job at removing all of the wrinkles in 1-3 passes. The biggest negative for me was that it sputters water a bit. I had this issues with my older steamer so it‚Äôs not a huge deal breaker, and so far I have had 0 issues with water stains but I can imagine on very delicate materials it could be bad. I also didn‚Äôt experience these droplets spilling onto my skin but the water is at boiling point so I would be careful.

I mentioned that the first time I used the steamer, it worked fine, but the second time, it spit water all over my clothing. The company contacted me and offered to make things right: they would send a new one without returning the first one or whatever I suggested to satisfy me. They also asked to see a photo of the steamer spitting water. When I filled the steamer with water so that I could take a photo, I realized that I had probably overfilled the reservoir the time it spit water. I filled it to the ‚ÄúMax‚Äù mark, turned it on, let it heat up, and found it did not spit water at all . The reservoir needs space for the water to bubble and boil WITHIN the confines of the reservoir. Otherwise, it WILL bubble outside of the nozzle.

I will say the vibrancy of the purple diminished a bit after washing and drying, but all 6 towels in the set very slightly faded equally. The towels definitely fluffed up to about an 8/10 on the fluffy thickness scale. All the stitching around the boarders were in tact, but I did notice some of the loops in the bath towels starting to come unraveled. I couple of minor spots here and there, but I will not judge that until the next washing. Perhaps it is lint still in the towel that is giving that appearance. I will give the benefit of the doubt to the towel for now. They came out of the dryer fairly soft to the skin, not as soft as White Classic towels, but close, thicker than the Hammam Linen towels, but the Hammam towels despite the lack of thickness, are really soft and absorbent. I suppose we will see with the next wash if these American Soft Linen Measure up to the test and are absorbent after a shower. So far I would say it is a nice quality towel, but it still needs to go through some everyday use for a final verdict. These towels were packaged nicely and the color out of the box was vibrant and matched the color on the website. They were reasonably thick about a 6.5/10 on thickness and were very soft out of the box/bag. A few stray threads, but nothing to get upset about, everything seemed sewn together well, so far. They are currently in the wash by themselves for their first cleaning. So we will see how they come out. Will finish the review after they come out of the dryer on tumble low with 4 100% Aussie wool dryer balls as the softening and fluffing agent.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c5a;RZKPNOF6B7MI3;;2022-11-07;TRUE;B007E83LUM;5.0;These work but please use them as a last resort if you have any empathy at all. They can hurt you. I tend to live and let live but after almost 2 thousand dollars work on a new truck that a rat decided was a warm place under the hood to make a home and chew wires I had to declare war on the rodents around our place. It was only self defense. I took three days but my husband and I cleaned out the garage and started parking the newly repaired truck in there. It takes some effort because it's a big truck and a tiny garage but needs must. I knew there was a mouse in there. I had seen her on the security camera I have in there. I started to try to catch her first with the clear plastic humane live traps. I have lived in the country for years and they do almost always work. I check them often, drive out someplace remote, open the end and and shake the mouse out. It's easy and it's safe and it's fun to watch them bound out into the grass so happy after their near-death experience. The mouse in the garage was far too smart for that... no matter what delicious thing I baited them with. She resisted them all. I tried other things. LOTS of other things. I tried gradually more lethal things but no dice. I saw her on the security camera almost nightly. She would have none of it. Finally I resorted to the glue boards. They have always eventually worked although it is heart rending to find the mouse in them, hopelessly mired.. sometimes dead, usually just MOSTLY dead and trying to breathe with the glue blocking their airways. If they aren't too bad off I have gotten them free with vegetable oil and let them go but they always seem damaged and unlikely to survive. Usually, I put them in a grocery bag and kill them with a brick. It upsets me to imagine that some people just throw them away to suffer in what little time they have left in the garbage. I have no dislike of them. They don't mean anyone any harm. They just want someplace warm and something to eat. I'd do the same if I was a mouse and so would you. It looked like this mouse was too smart for this too. Days went by. I checked the glue boards I had put in places I knew a mouse would go. No dice. I was really starting to respect how smart this mouse was. I knew she would want all the things that I baited everything with but she was too careful and brainy to fall for any of it. Then, yesterday I saw her on the security camera running back and fourth under the truck. This was unusual so I went out and found 3 young mice.. just old enough to leave the nest and start exploring, stuck in some of the glue boards. Silly little innocent things looking at me with wide, frightened eyes. They were too mired and damaged to set free. They were also too young. Winter is almost here. I killed them. I considered putting a dead one in the center of a ring of the glue boards I was pretty sure this would work but I decided I could never sink that low so I just replaced the boards with new ones. This morning, I found one more baby in one of the glue traps. Next to it was my nemesis mouse. She had tried to help her last baby and had gotten mired. They were both alive but just barely. Too far gone to try to free. I admit I cried after I dealt with them and threw all the remaining used boards away and replaced them with the plastic humane traps. If I am wrong and there is another baby I will probably catch the silly little thing. And I will make sure it survives one way or another and I will set it free. It is the only thing I can do for her now. I am sure that most people reading this will think I am an idiot but I feel I should do the best I can. You don't have to care as much as I do but at least try the plastic humane traps first and check them every day. They do work and it is good for your karma.;What happened this morning.;real;real;B007E83LUM;52;Home & Kitchen;Pest Glue Trap by Catchmaster - 36 Boards Pre-Baited, Ready to Use Indoors.

We have a young toddler so this must be taken care of immediately. A couple months ago we had a gas line installed and they drilled a hole to the house. My husband assumed this is where it/they came from. I took a loaf of bread just purchased a few days prior out of the pantry, bite marks and a hole through it and some bread eaten. This had to be handled and handled fast. Seal the hole, and possible catch any critters around asap. Came across this product. I disregarded reviews for this being a somewhat traumatic process as we've owned snakes over a decade that have always fed on live mice/rats. It's nature and it's a quick death although I don't find it amusing, my snakes have to eat. We received this item the next day after ordering the night before. We needed it fast. It arrived on time in good shape ready to be used. My husband placed them under the stove (where we also found feces) and in the entrances of the pantry and coat closet. The baby woke up briefly around 4 am so I went to grab some diapers stored near the coat closet. I turned around and saw it. It was dim besides a small lamp we keep on in the living room on overnight. I saw the pad in front of the kitchen sink and appeared to have something on it. I was half asleep and processing this. It appeared dead on its side. I kept staring at it wondering what it was doing there SEVERAL feet from where it was placed UNDER the stove. After staring at what I thought was a dead mouse and slowly inching closer it started struggling and squirming. It appeared there was 2 on there but my husband later confirmed the other side of the pad was the mouses fur or hair that was stripped during it's struggle. I discovered it lying on the other side of its body where there was still hair. I instantly went to wake my husband and have him dispose of it and put it out of its misery. It clearly put up quite a struggle and was a lot stronger and larger then any mouse in my years of experience. It's about 6 hours after the ordeal and I can't stop seeing it. I mean the entire half side of its body's hair was on half of the pad while it was on the other. We also have 2 teenagers that would have no doubt felt pity and some level of trauma had they witnessed this. Our snake is due to feed this weekend. I don't think I'll participate for a while. It works as it should and fast, but it's rough.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c5a;R3RSAFTT5XDPVR;;2023-04-14;TRUE;B007E83LUM;4.0;At my home we have had an ongoing mouse problem. No matter what we do to patch up the entrances, there always appears to be another way in (the joys of living in a home over 100 years old). I have used these traps for awhile now and for the price and the quantity you receive, it's an unbeatable deal. However, I would be lying if I said these are 100% effective. Sometimes, the mice that get caught can chew their way out, depending on how they are trapped. And while, yes, the idea is to have this in a box shape, laying it flat also works, but, again, you run the risk of the mice being able to either chew their way free, or drag the trap elsewhere. I do occasionally break out the heavy duty traps if I feel like I'm going to have issues with mice and while they work 100% of the time, they are also VERY expensive. I'd recommend laying out these traps, placing poison under your home before the mice can get in and doing your best to seal up any and all ways that they can get into your home.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c5a;RIHKDFZFW1A0T;;2022-12-22;TRUE;B007E83LUM;4.0;We had a mouse invasion early this year due to Kids leaving doors open, in late winter - early spring. I had some classic wooden traps om hand, and a bucket with ramp and trap door. None of these worked with various baits. I decided to try these sticky traps. Know that mice can be easily removed from these sticky traps by placing oil (I use Olive Oil) under the mice and then holding the traps vertically. Every movement the mice makes pulls them away and the oil prevent reattachment. Usually the mouse is free within minute. It is important to see the mice and do this before they exhaust themselves and die or are too weak to release themselves in this manner or survive once released. Out of 50 mice I would say 40+ were released alive. My son liked this job. First let me tell you that those cartoon you watched as children of clever mice are not fiction. I though they were, but mice are amazingly smart creatures. I laid trap between rooms to contain. Containment is key. This is not a quick fix unless maybe you have very few mice, and then maybe. Mine was a WAR! I used a security system I installed using software that could capture movement and trigger an alert on the system which made it easy to look back at any movement caught. This was a great tool which allowed me to see where they were moving and devise a strategy to further refine the battle plan. Know that mice are able to jump, climb, walk sideways on a wall with the smallest of footholds. Some of my video is stunning. I found that in many areas I saw larger mice able to jump over a single width of traps and I had to place them two wide side-by-side in places. Some mice managed to get to the door frame climbing sideways and jump over traps as well. I do not like the system these use for connecting them together. Too much surface is not sticky between each trap. I use a razor to cut off much of the ends and connect the traps with packing tape on the cardboard bottom side. This also makes for easy separation from the rest when one requires removal to save a mouse. Do not underestimate these critters. Extend your lines of defense further than you might think. If you separate mice from water, food, they will get desperate and find a way if they can. We went 7 weeks without a sign of mice. My house is sealed well on the outside and these IMO were surely clever holdouts. We just discovered two in the laundry room just today and the war is back on some 16 weeks after we though the war was over. I was glad I kept a solid two plus wide line of traps at the door. Much wider than the door BTW, by about a trap length further on each side and at least double wide line of traps. The war is back on.

Well, hubby just laid them down and didn't form the pyramid. He came down stairs with our cat's back feet stuck on one and his foot stuck on the other. It took a half cup of vegetable oil to unstick them. Afterwards I had a good laugh at the predicament he was in. He couldn't get the glue trap off his foot!

Despite that little issue, I will continue to use them and see what happens. I am hoping I do not have to get out my hammer again.;Patience is a virtue;real;real;B007E83LUM;52;Home & Kitchen;Pest Glue Trap by Catchmaster - 36 Boards Pre-Baited, Ready to Use Indoors.

It seems to do a very good job of catching all sorts of bugs. A single trap has lasted months and they're very easy to replace. You can throw them in corners, under fridges, tool benches, etc. Since these don't contain pesticides, they should be safe to place indoors as well.;This is a great value for glue traps;real;real;B007E83LUM;52;Home & Kitchen;Pest Glue Trap by Catchmaster - 36 Boards Pre-Baited, Ready to Use Indoors.

The frames themselves are well-made and of high quality. The set includes five frames, which after looking around seemed like an excellent value for money. While designed to display either a 9x15 inch picture with the included mat or an 11x17 inch picture without the mat, I needed for 11x17 print and it fit perfectly. I particularly liked the sleek and modern look of the frames. The black frames have a simple design that does not detract from the artwork that I spent a lot of time creating. The plexiglass cover comes with a protective film so they arrive with no scratches (also packaged well to that end). Additionally, the frames come with hanging hardware, making it easy to display them on the wall. Due to the frames being very lightweight, I opted to use 3M strips with Velcro to attach to the wall because its personally easier for me to line up multiple frames that way (or move them just a bit if you are off).;Great for team posters!;real;real;B07VQZSLDW;53;Home & Kitchen;upsimples 11x14 Picture Frame Set of 5, Display Pictures 8x10 with Mat or 11x14 Without Mat, Wall Gallery Photo Frames, Black;51623;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:31:45.848

These frames are the perfect combination of sleek and stylish, and they are the perfect addition to any room. The frames come in a set of five, which is great for creating a gallery wall or displaying multiple photos at once. The frames themselves are well-made and sturdy, and they come with both an easel stand and hanging hardware for easy display. I also appreciate that these frames are versatile and can accommodate both 8x10 photos with the included mat or 11x14 photos without the mat. This flexibility makes it easy to switch up the photos and create new displays whenever I want. I would highly recommend the Picture Frame Set to anyone looking for high-quality, stylish frames at an affordable price.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c5d;R3ADJNDZPJ0WZG;;2021-05-26;TRUE;B073ZY6XH3;5.0;My husband and I bought a new bedroom suit, upgrading our mattress size to king. We opted for a cheap mattress since we were buying the suit, with plans to replace the mattress at a later date. The mattress we purchased was memory foam. Memory foam can make you sweat, and our mattress does just that. So much so that we will likely wind up having to replace it sooner than later, not saving anything in the long run. I purchased this cover for two reasons. First, to try to cut down on the sweating. Second, I can‚Äôt wash the mattress, so I always add a mattress pad or protector that can be washed if needed. My review of this pad is that it‚Äôs sort of like a thick, fluffy comforter. It‚Äôs kind of squishy. I am not sure what I was expecting but I was going for the feel of a pillow top. It doesn‚Äôt feel like that but it doesn‚Äôt feel like you just tucked a comforter under your sheet either. All I can say is that it made the mattress a lot softer. Whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of opinion. My husband doesn‚Äôt sleep well on it but didn‚Äôt sleep well on the mattress. He still sweats but not as much (didn‚Äôt on our old pillow top - it‚Äôs the mattress). I wouldn‚Äôt say that this would resolve that issue/cool you down that much. He also says it is too soft in comparison to our daughter‚Äôs (doesn‚Äôt have the pad on her bed). I tend to think that his issues can‚Äôt be resolved without replacing the mattress and am not going to blame them on the pad. The fact is, I doubt there is a pad on the market that would make him like our current mattress any more than he does. As for me? I like it. Our old pillow top had gotten too soft for me (your core changes quite a bit when you have twins!) and I was having trouble getting in and out of bed at night to check on the kids. My hips were hurting constantly and my back spasms made it more efficient for me to just sleep on the couch. The new mattress was a bit uncomfortable for me, and this pad improved my quality of sleep tremendously. It is soft enough that my hips don‚Äôt kill me when I lay on my side at night, my back spasms have mostly stopped so that I‚Äôm better able to get in and out of bed with the kids, and I just feel comfortable when I‚Äôm laying in it. I am not someone that has ever owned an expensive mattress and this is an improvement over the egg crates we used to use when I was a kid. My mom and sister liked it enough to get one for their beds and have liked using them so far (they have the same mattress and found it uncomfortable as well.... I have not laundered mine but my sister washes hers weekly and has not complained). At the end of the day, this mattress cover is not going to make your mattress feel like a pillow top or high end mattress if it isn‚Äôt. It also isn‚Äôt going to make your mattress feel like you crammed a comforter under your sheets. It doesn‚Äôt slide around or bunch up. It is not going to solve any problems with night sweats, and it is probably going to be too soft if you like a firm mattress. What it is likely to do is add some cushion to an otherwise too firm mattress. If your mattress is so unsupportive that your hips hurt when you lay on your side at night, it might help. If you‚Äôre tossing and turning and not sleeping well because of that sort of thing, it may help. If you just want to add a little cushion, it might help. If you just want a mattress cover you can launder, it would work (I don‚Äôt believe it is waterproof but we didn‚Äôt need that). As for us, it is an okay purchase. Didn‚Äôt solve my husband‚Äôs problems but solved mine and I‚Äôm grateful for that. I‚Äôm sure that we will soon be replacing the mattress with a better quality, non memory foam one, and when we do, we won‚Äôt be using this any longer. For now, I think it was worth the money. I don‚Äôt have any complaints so I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars. That doesn‚Äôt mean it upgraded our mattress - it just means that it does what I believe it was advertised to do and I got what I expected from it.;Okay;real;real;B073ZY6XH3;55;Home & Kitchen;"EASELAND Queen Size Mattress Pad Pillow Top Mattress Cover Quilted Fitted Mattress Protector Cotton Top 8-21"" Deep Pocket Cooling Mattress Topper (60x80 Inches, White)";86715;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:32:01.798

That said, I get that it is a very useful service for many folx, especially those who can't leave their houses, which was all of us in spring 2020. (Funny how that time hasn't resulted in more accommodations for folx with disabilities!) With my guilt-fueled pontificating about Amazon complete, I will now admit that I bought this to bring with me on a cross-country train ride in the summer of 2020! My partner and I were moving from East Coast to West and we decided that taking a 3-day Amtrak was less virally terrifying than flying. In retrospect this seems a bizarre decision warped into life by quarantine brain, but it worked because we could bring our bikes and LOTS of bags with us for very little money which would not have been possible on an airplane. We managed to fork out enough for a private room on the California Zephyr (thanks pandemic prices!) and my belief was that this would be a totally safe situation IF we had an air purifier on board. Reader, I was... misguided. This is a big object! Which I would've known if my panicked mind had taken five seconds to read the size specifications. There was no way I was going to get it into my duffle bag, let alone set it up in the Kleenex box of an Amtrak sleeper compartment. Also, if I had managed to bring along my air safety friend, in retrospect it probably would've tripped the break for the whole train car. So, the round Levoit went into the cross-country crap delivery box although really I should've just sold it rather than paying for its weight to follow me to California. However! I was glad my fear-shredded mind decided not to let it go because the first month we lived in the Bay Area, this air purifier was absolutely clutch for making our bedroom sleepable during all the fires. It did not protect us from COVID at any point, but it cleared out slithery window-breaching smoke like a rockstar. I was impressed. Suddenly the size seemed too small for such power. Several years later it is a beloved member of our house of droids (including a keep-warm coffee pot that hisses, a vacuum that burps, and a rice cooker that squeals.) It handily clears out the smell when I've accidentally left the window open above my next-door neighbors' weed smoking spot. It also keeps our room from reeking of farts after a night of post-beans sleep. Terrific purchase in the long run. I make sure to dust it regularly and pat it affectionately every day.;COVID terror purchase become beloved house droid;real;real;B07VVK39F7;56;Home & Kitchen;LEVOIT Air Purifier for Home Allergies Pets Hair in Bedroom, H13 True HEPA Filter, Covers Up to 1095 Sq.Foot, 24db Filtration System, Remove 99.97% Dust Smoke Mold Pollen, Core 300, White;84793;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:32:10.254

It's completely silent in night mode and pretty dang quiet on Low. It doesn't move a ton of air, so it's really only going to work well in an office or small bedroom. The 400S that I had has issues. After returning it, I realized other people have had this issue too. The device is unusable on Night Mode and Fan 1. The motor for the 400S makes a higher frequency noise above the fan noise that is unbearable. It's extremely annoying. If you don't mind running it constantly on Fan 2 or OFF then it's perfect. To me this is unacceptable. The EverestAir is the best out of all the Levoit Products I have. It's quiet on all fan settings and covers the most amount of space. If you have a large space, just buy this. Trust me, if you want a quality product that can actually handle large spaces and be quiet you need something this big and expensive. I got mine on sale for $400. I'm really impressed with the Smart App that the devices use (VeSync). You can setup custom programs for the purifiers, and basically customize it any way you want (if/and/then stuff).;Great Depending On Room Size!;real;real;B07VVK39F7;56;Home & Kitchen;LEVOIT Air Purifier for Home Allergies Pets Hair in Bedroom, H13 True HEPA Filter, Covers Up to 1095 Sq.Foot, 24db Filtration System, Remove 99.97% Dust Smoke Mold Pollen, Core 300, White;84793;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:32:10.254

I have had allergies and asthma all my life. I had just accepted the fact that I couldn‚Äôt breath properly through my nose at night and sneezing, and would wake up to a congested filled nose. I take a antihistamine every day and have for all my life as I have severe allergies. I was to the point where I was considering going to the doctor every week to get an allergy shot. But who wants to do that? I‚Äôve tried every thing from nasal sprays to sinus rinses. Nothing offered relief. As a last desperate attempt I decided I finally needed to buy one of these, I‚Äôd been thinking about it for years. I haven‚Äôt done it yet because I was skeptical that a little air filter could really make a difference for my allergies, plus these things aren‚Äôt exactly cheap. I did my research and found this one for a relatively decent price, and has great reviews. Plus I‚Äôm pregnant and I was thinking about the quality of air for my newborn as well. I decided to finally just buy it. The first night I used it, my husband set it up for me and within an hour the air in the room smelled clean. I‚Äôf you‚Äôve ever been to Washington state or live there with the evergreen trees, you know that clean air smell. I told my husband the real test will be to see if I sneeze at all tonight. We go to sleep, I wake up in the morning feeling so refreshed. I realized to my amazement that I was NATURALLY breathing through my nose. That is the first time in my life I‚Äôve ever woken up able to breathe through my nose. I‚Äôm 27. I realized I hadn‚Äôt sneezed at all throughout the night, and I woke up feeling energized and refreshed like I was actually able to get quality sleep. I had started to think I had insomnia, but I just wasn‚Äôt able to breath properly! I feel like a new woman! It literally makes me want to cry. This product is slightly bigger than I expected it to be, but I just set it up on a little table next to my bed and the size doesn‚Äôt bother me especially with how great it works. It looks nicer than I expected it too, and is quieter than I thought it would be as well. If you or a loved one has allergies, asthma, a newborn, or simply want a cleaner smelling house this is a MUST HAVE. I will never in my life go without one of these things again.

I sleep with a CPAP that filters the air while I sleep. So all night long I get pure clean air and I noticed when I wak up in the morning and take off my mask the first couple breathes of my household air was best desribed as very stale and dusty. Its hard to explain but it wasn't good and I was shocked at how bad it really was because after about 2 or 3 breathes your brain gets used to it and you don't notice it anymore until the next morning when I take off that CPAP mask. Because of this I decided to purchase this Levoit Core 300. For the size of my house 1380 square foot I probably should have bought two but was hoping one would at least make a difference. I recieved it 3 days ago and when I opened it up and set it up which was extremely easy and everything seems very good quality, I ran it on the highest setting for about 8 hours. After that I set it on the middle setting of 2 and it is barely able to be heard. It sits in my living room and honestly without a second one in my bedroom I didn't expect much of a difference when I went to bed. Waking up the following morning and it now running about 16 hours I took off my mask and was shocked that I could barely tell a difference between the filtered air of my CPAP and the house air. The second morning no difference at all it was pure clean air like when I sleep with my CPAP. I am totally impressed. Looks like I don't even need a second one but I plan on getting a second one soon for the bedroom anyways. It is a great product. I expect my allergies will become better which I think I've already noticed and the house is dust free right now.

Noise level is great, night mode is much quieter, but I suggest using higher fan speed to clean up the room air before sleep. One online review tested that core 300 could remove 96% air particles in an hour (moderncastle), I think it's true base on my experience of a month. Another reason to buy this is that the filter is at a medium-cheap price level, manual says a filter change is recommended every 6 months with manual vacuuming the outside. Pretty economic if you clean it often. I recommend this! (However, how could it tell that the filter needs changing, if it doesn't have a post-filter air quality sensor? If it has such sensor, why 300s is much more expensive with just one additional sensor?);Very good!

I can see a future where we buy another one for our upstairs at some point because right now we rotate it where we need it smell wise, usually keeping it in the kitchen.

I dont use the smart feature because I don't want to join and give my password for wifi to the app. Wish they made a remote and gave a choice to which you wanted to use. I have run these for a couple weeks and really like them. I don't recommend that you try and cover multiple rooms with them. After talking to lots of people they really think that you need one per room and I would agree. They do what they promise. I think that level 4 which is full is not bad for noise. If you want quiet the lower settings and sleep settings are better but not really noisy and you can easily carry on a conversation with it on high. Really a nice unit for the price. They will cover almost twice the room size of the 300s. For the filter costs and how often you need to change filters these were the best for the budget. I watched a lot of reviews on different makes and models and tried several but these did the same job and the replacement filter cost was the best as far as I could tell. Im really happy with the unit so far. I did try and call the company number just to see how hard it would be to talk with a real person and can you believe it that due to COVID they are not taking calls at this time.

I have 2 cats whom I love dearly but even if they are the source of some of my allergies, not having them around is NOT an option! Set-up was easy, just unbox, remove the filter to take off plastic bag it comes in, reinsert filter & you're good to go. The night mode is whisper quiet which is great for sleeping but I wonder just how much filtration it can do at such a low speed. Fan speed #1 is a nice white noise sound if you ever need that. #2 sounds like a loud fan to me & #3, well, a really loud fan--I can't see me ever using this speed altho if I needed to clear heavy smells, it sounds like it might do that quickly. One problem for me which I would have with any air purifier is that I live in an old house & my bedroom is the coldest in the winter (& hottest in the summer) as it's at the v end of the vent runs. So, on cold nights, it's chilly running the air purifier which essentially is running a fan that pushes already cold air around. I've almost consider running a space heater for awhile when the purifier is set at higher speeds--brrr! But, it will prob be a nice addition to my ceiling fan in the summer. I do think my allergy symptoms improved some after I started using this in my bedroom at night. It seems like just a low dose of antihistamines is all I need now to control my symptoms but I've started to get small nosebleeds so I'm wondering if running it all night is drying out the bedroom air too much (I have a whole house humidifier on the furnace) even though I run it on night mode. I may start running it during the day instead for an experiment. It does seem to help odor control altho that is not much of an issue as the cats' litter boxes are not that close to my bedroom. Seems like a quality product. Controls easy to use & as mentioned, being able to turn off all the LED lights is fantastic. Does it work? I think so but I don't honestly know--I've been using it about a month & the filter has collected some visible material which is a relief as they are expensive to replace.

Picked up a one of these and sprayed perimiter of the house (foundation and under siding is best) and around the doors.

Here are some pros and cons: Pros: 1. The blanket is incredibly soft and plush, making it very comfortable to snuggle up in. 2. The 50x60 inch size (which I purchased) is perfect for curling up on the couch and is large enough to cover most people from head to toe. 3. The grey color (which I bought) is neutral and can match with a variety of decor styles. 4. The blanket is lightweight, making it easy to move around and use in different rooms. 5. The pricing is excellent and I could not find any other product with similar features that was close to it in pricing. Cons: 1. The blanket may shed a bit when first taken out of the package, so it's recommended to wash it before use. 2. Has shown signs of pilling after extended use, which may decrease the softness and coziness of the blanket over time. Eventually, I will report on how it fared in long run. 3. The blanket is not very thick or heavy, so it may not be warm enough for extremely cold temperatures. Overall, this is a good choice for those looking for a soft and cozy blanket for their home at a budget. While there may be some issues with shedding and pilling, the pros outweigh the cons and make it a solid purchase.;Value for money product at a very good price.;fake;real;B0157T1ZK2;58;Home & Kitchen;Bedsure Fleece Throw Blanket for Couch Grey - Lightweight Plush Fuzzy Cozy Soft Blankets and Throws for Sofa, 50x60 inches;144242;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:32:27.224

It works fine, but it has a rubber smell, and some parts aren‚Äôt made very well. So I bought this one, because I‚Äôve always wanted one, I was jealous that he had one, and I wanted him to see a real handheld vac. I accidentally bought two, so now he has two. If I cared more, I would make a video. The B & D is superior! Yay! And only $10 more. It has better suction, is clearly more sturdy and it doesn‚Äôt have any stinky odors. It‚Äôs also more convenient because all the attachments are actually attached, so you‚Äôre not going to lose them, or need the little bag that comes with the portutif. That being said, my dad‚Äôs vac (besides the odor that he can‚Äôt seem to smell), is a fine handheld vacuum. It advertises around a 25 min battery charge, but has much longer. The differences in suction is not that much. I prefer the Black & Decker, it doesn‚Äôt take too long to charge (I didn‚Äôt time it yet) after the battery runs down. And it is very convenient. One little annoyance: it has a place to hang it on the wall, but doesn‚Äôt come with the thing to hang it on. Irritating right? Yet my dad‚Äôs cheaper one can hang out all day long on the wall, mocking me. I will update with any big developments in my vac‚Äôs life. BTW, both vacs are strong enough to suck up a large bug. Neither are strong enough to kill the large bug -that is, if you happen to have a large bug in your home in a hard to reach place.

After about 2 months, the battery started going. Now, after having the vacuum for 3 months, it lasts for about half as long as it used to, the crevice tool is broken, and the vacuum's suction is only strong for about 10 minutes. Three months ago when I bought this, it was a great vacuum. Here were the perks : - Excellent suction - Doesn't blow dust out of the back - Easy to empty - Lightweight - Built-in crevice tool means you don't lose it, and it's easy to use (and clean). Great for getting underneath stuff Initial drawbacks : - The vents in the dust cup get clogged with dust immediately and are difficult to clean - The connection the vacuum makes with the charging station is precarious. You have to be careful to make sure it turns on and that it doesn't get jostled while charging. - The vacuum doesn't seem to last as long as it should (maybe about 30 minutes). When it starts to lose power, it takes about 5-10 minutes to fully die, but during that time it becomes increasingly useless, depositing anything larger than dust if you tilt it slightly while cleaning. Other vacuums I've had in the past remained powerful for a longer period of time before completely dying. - This vacuum doesn't have quite as much suction as the best handheld I've had, but it also doesn't blow half of the dirt and dust it collects out of the back of the vacuum while you're using it. It WILL, however, blow some dust out of the back, so don't put your face behind it. - Like every other handheld vacuum I've found, the crevice tool and nozzle will easily scratch a lot of soft surfaces like the top of large plastic bins and soft wood floors, desks, and countertops. You have to be careful with what you use it on. How I used this vacuum for the past 3 months : - Vacuum was used, on average, probably about once every week and a half to two weeks - When used, vacuum would sometimes be used for two sessions in one day, with about 3-5 hours of charging in-between. - Emptied vacuum when 1/2 to 3/4ths full - Tapped out dust cap each time - Scraped dust out of clogged vents in dust cap - About half the time, I allowed the vacuum to die fully before charging it fully. - Vacuum was constantly kept on the charger and usually plugged in. - Vacuum was used for light pickup - dust, dirt, flour, crumbs, small amounts of pet hair on upholstery, mouse poo...you get the point Here's my review after 3 months : - The crevice tool started to not click into place and the problem got progressively worse. Now it barely clicks, comes loose, and starts to slide into the vacuum during use. It seems to happen as a result of the crevice tool bumping into things. The connection just isn't very strong to begin with. The crevice tool only works well if you hold it so it's nearly flat against the surface. Otherwise, there isn't enough suction. - The amount of time the vacuum can be used for has decreased from about 30 minutes to about 15 minutes - The is only at its highest suction for maybe 10 minutes How this vacuum compares to handhelds I've used in the past : What's better : - Suction was almost as good as the best handheld I've had - Blew out far less dust than most, including the best handheld I've had - Easier to use than most - Better at getting into nooks and under things - Easier to tell when the vacuum is full - The curvature of the design makes the vacuum more maneuverable - The crevice tool makes the vacuum incredibly versatile - The vacuum is effective on upholstery and mattresses, unlike many What's worse : - The suction stayed powerful for a much shorter period of time, with a longer stretch of ""sub par"" vacuuming ability - The battery seemed less and less effective starting at two months, and now appears to be half as effective as it was when I purchased the vacuum - The vents on the dust cup clog almost immediately, causing unnecessary stress on the unit - The charging port does not make as firm of a connection with the device as other handhelds do - If the vacuum is bumped or jostled slightly while charging it will misalign with the connection. You'll come back hours later and it will still be dead. - The ""click into place"" aspect of the crevice tool wears down very quickly when the crevice tool bumps against things, and will eventually stop working - The hard plastic crevice tool scratches soft surfaces easily, and the brush attachment does very little. It's also very easy to accidentally angle the vacuum wrong when using the brush attachment, causing the bottom of the crevice tool to scrape against the surface. - The crevice tool does not have much suction or power, so you need to hold it almost flat against the surface you're vacuuming to get it to have suction, which makes it far less versatile. - After 3 months, this vacuum is no longer appropriate for cleaning upholstery Changes I would like to see : - Better connection with the charging station - Flexible rubber crevice tool OR a removable rubber cover for the top of the crevice tool - Multi-layered venting system for dust cup that can be easily disassembled for cleaning - UV light for inside of dust cup to kill dust mites and dust mite eggs - Removable and replaceable dust-filter attachment specifically designed for vacuuming dust. - Ability to use corded, or cordless - Longer-lasting battery - Suction that has more staying power (can probably be achieved by redesigning dust cup) - Free, cheap, or DIY battery replacement If you're anything like me, you wouldn't mind paying more for at least ONE handheld that had the POTENTIAL for some of these features, even if it doesn't necessarily come with them. I don't mind paying extra for my toppings, as long as toppings are possible. This could be a great product that really sets itself apart.";Better than most.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c61;R2L46SGL12L5XW;;2017-10-11;TRUE;B006LXOJC0;3.0;I like the long extendable pickup and overall sucking power. Not a big fan of the counter-top charge base (I would have preferred a wall mount). But after 3.5 years of light-duty use (under five minutes run time each week) my CHV1410L vacuum's battery died. Unfortunately the battery is NOT a user-replaceable item. That's a shame because the vacuum still looks new. And it would be wasteful to toss it in the trash just because Black & Decker didn't design this appliance so we could change the battery pack. For this reason the vacuum only gets 3 stars from me. Fortunately I have many years experience working on electronic equipment. I have rebuilt a few lithium battery packs too. So I decided to replace my vacuum's batteries. This is not a project for the average person, so skip this idea if you are not familiar with lithium battery safety. I disassembled the vacuum by removing six screws. Once inside I found that the battery pack can be removed by unplugging a connector. As luck would have it, the battery pack's plastic case is held together by two plastic tabs that snap apart. Inside the case are four (4) 18650 size lithium batteries and the cell charge protection circuit board. The rebuilding process was straight forward. I used four 18650 high current flat top cells (rated 20A continuous operation). These type of cells are found in some high capacity vaping devices. While soldering the cells it is critical to avoid overheating them. I used a temperature controlled iron, added flux, and worked fast to minimize the heat dwell time. The cells I used came from Amazon, but the vendor removed the listing shortly after I purchased them (so I'm unable to provide a link). I don't intend this review to be a battery rebuilding instructable. Instead, I'm here to say that the battery will probably last 3-4 years and then your vacuum will become another electronic landfill waste item. This problem isn't limited to this product, but such a shame that manufacturers don't do more to break us from modern society's throw-away habits. EDIT Dec-12-2022: It's been many years since I wrote my original review. Just wanted to come back and report that I'm still using the Black & Decker cordless vacuum, which is nearly 10 years old. The rebuilt battery pack is still going strong too.

It also is so light that when tossing and turning during sleep, you can‚Äôt just easily pull it back over as it has less than zero heft - usually once or twice a night I have to actually half wake up in order to rearrange it.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c62;R3B71HSCSTZG6S;;2017-12-29;TRUE;B00S1TC442;5.0;"For the past couple years my girlfriend and I have gone through a few cheap comforters. We never really gave much thought to them and subsequently they never impressed us. I grew up using a down comforter and have very fond memories of that blanket. The comfort and warmth was something that I hadn't experienced since I had moved out and gotten my own comforter. So this has been in the back of my mind ever since but I wasn't sure if I wanted to dish out that kind of money for a blanket and also deal with the hassle of dry cleaning it. Also by purchasing a down blanket we'd be supporting an industry in which the down feathers from geese are taken from them and that's not something we personally wanted to support. So for all those reason we started looking into down alternative. The first thing that made me question these products was the price, they seem TOO cheap. I was raised with the mantra, ""you get what you pay for"" and with that in mind I was quite weary when looking at these products. I always make sure to compare many different products and read through the reviews, both good and bad before I buy something. I decided to take a chance on this particular one as it seemed to be the highest rated by customers and I liked what I saw in the images provided by said customer. If anything, the price was low enough that I wasn't too worried if I didn't end up liking it. Now I wasn't actually home when it arrived but my girlfriend confirmed that it was very flat right out of the package, as was expected. By the time I got home 2-3 hours later it appeared to be fully fluffed. The material it is made of is very soft and comfortable on your skin and I was pleasantly surprised with the thickness/fluffyness. It is a fairly light blanket, similar to a down blanket I suppose in that regard. So far I have only slept with it one night but it did a great job of keeping me warm. I live in Wisconsin and the temperatures this week have been ranging from -10 over night to single digits during the day. I had been using 2 blankets prior to getting this one and sometimes I would still wake up in the night feeling cold. But so far with this blanket alone I have stayed warm which again was a pleasant surprise. I do have to say that this doesn't remind me a whole lot of my down blanket and I think that may have to do with the material used in the shell. And you're not going to be 100% able to recreate a down blanket not using down. So if you are looking for something that feels exactly like down and won't be satisfied otherwise, this might not be for you. However, if you are looking for a good quality, warm, fluffy and affordable priced blanket that will give you that ""cloud"" like feeling, I think you would be really happy with this blanket. Again this is my opinion from using it for one night, I can not comment on the durability or longevity of this blanket, but I am hoping that it holds up over time. **also our cats immediately fell in love with it, it is their new favorite spot to nap.";Pleasant surprise, warm and fluffy;real;real;B00S1TC442;60;Home & Kitchen;Utopia Bedding Comforter Duvet Insert - Quilted Comforter with Corner Tabs - Box Stitched Down Alternative Comforter (Queen, White);104331;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:32:43.082

But figured I would for this as I love it. Purchased in June 2022, left in original box in storage until today (3/11/2023). Opened, no pieces missing, assembled with (not provided) screwdriver (main body) and hammer/mallet (Cardboardish back piece). Beautiful. My only complaint is that the 3 main ""walls"" (long A, B, and C pieces) did not have stickers on them telling which was which besides A; but they were self explanatory, C (the middle partition) was the only one with an unfinished side. Well, that and the middle divider (piece C iirc) is only green on one side, although this matches the 3 E piece ""shelves"" for if you turn it horizontal or for width rather than height. Which the instruction (clear and detailed with pictures) booklet does not demonstrate as a possible configuration, notably, so be warned. The 3 small ""E"" shelves all say they hold 10 lbs max each, with no recommendation for top at all (assuming you should not place anything of significant weight on it either). That said, White on outside and Green on inside is the assembly instructions for the unit I purchased, although I did fit it for the opposite and that seems possible as well, though I decided to assemble as guided, with green interior. The E shelves are also only Green on one side, white on the other (all painted/finished though). Not much else I can say, other than that the 3-side cannot fit a Berserk Deluxe Volume unless you turn it horizontal, of which each can fit exactly one comfortably. All said, you can easily fit one in each, and 4 on each on the right side, leading to easily 11 volumes if you want to. As pictured I went for 7 inside shelves and the rest on top with miscellaneous other books in the 3 smaller shelves. This really helped organize the very small room I placed it in (an full sized bed takes up roughly half of the room). Yeah, I paid $33 for it, but it's currently $30, and I have seen it cheaper since, so it can be caught for less than what I paid for it. May consider another or a similar model for other rooms or symmetry or gift in future. Well worth what I paid for it, though I only opened the box to assemble it roughly a year later. That's all I can think of.... Took about 30 minutes everything said, to assemble. Fairly lightweight to carry. Not too bulky, I assembled by myself though some people may require assistance.

I feel like my photos don't do the color justice because it's really a soft light green, and these make it look more like a sharp yellowish-green. I do like the color. And as others have mentioned, it is a bit of a shame that the directions aren't clear about the direction to connect the shelves. I had to reference the photo that showed how all the pieces will attach as well as coming back to this page to see how the colors align in order to make sure I was doing it right (especially in those first steps for the top shelves). They're pretty decent shelves as far as having a good amount of space on each shelf, the height, and being small enough to fit in a small apartment yet actually helpful for storage. The assembly is straightforward if you have experience with these kinds of projects but I had a few concerns. I believe the biggest problem is that it gives you the exact amount of all the pieces, meaning that if some come broken, you're just out of luck. Usually for shelves there will be one extra of most pieces. As shown, I did have a couple come broken and a wooden peg that split when I tried to use the mallet. With all three, I struggled when connecting the top shelves to the bottom shelves. When connecting, the circular metal connectors (I don't recall the exact name for them) are meant to turn 180¬∞ to secure the screws. But not a single one on any of them could. It felt like I was going to break the shelf itself, or threatened to strip those connectors. So there's a small gap there on each one, and nothing I tried was able to get them to connect snuggly. That and trying to screw in those black pieces behind the shelf were the hardest parts. It was pretty hard trying to screw into the shelf with no prep hole, with the screwdriver right up against the shelf with no room to hold it well. This shelf should have been really easy to put together (especially for someone like me with a lot of experience assembling furniture), but I ended up having hand cramps a few times. All-in-all they're what I needed so it will be fine. I just have to be careful with the one that has the broken peg since that one will be less safe (especially because it's at the part that can't connect properly). I do suggest getting your own straps to secure these to the wall, especially if you have kids or pets, because they're only stable as long as it doesn't get pushed on. Edit - I forgot to mention that the wood is a bit rough around the edges. The photo shows discoloration on the green, and that part feels really rough.

She is only 2-1/2 and I wanted her to have something that could be lower to the floor for her to reach without climbing. This is versatile for use either way which is a big part of the reason I bought it. When she's older, it can be stood on it's end the tall way if she wants it that way instead. Others I looked at had legs on them so they could only go one way. This was the better choice. The color goes nice with her room and it seems solid enough for the money. Laying it the long way gave more storage space, as well. They're happy with it and my granddaughter likes having her books down where she can safely get to them. I would recommend this product. I had purchased a blue one for my future grandson's room which looked nice in as well. They're going to use it for diapers and supplies right now until he's older and needs it for his books and toys. I think the shelves would be safe enough to stack, as well, if laid the long way.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c65;R36UJSSNSYCS2H;;2020-06-28;TRUE;B00S93EQUK;5.0;"This review covers the original Alpha Grillers Instant Read Meat Thermometer I purchased in February of 2017--and the new upgraded model you see here (June 2020 anyway). The original thermometer was purchased for $15 based on users reviews on Amazon. You can't find images of it here anymore (although you can see it in my picture comparing the 2017 model to the 2020 model), but it worked well enough and I've been mostly happy with it for the last three years. Recently it went from unreliably turning on, to not turning without removing the AAA battery and futzing with it (no corrosion) for 10 minutes. I was disappointed but $15 for three years of service and left out in the elements, I can't complain too much. I started to browse for a replacement and see that Alpha Grillers' has a ""lifetime warranty"" so I email them pictures of the unit, invoice info, etc. I kid you not: two days later, a replacement arrives from Amazon, and it's the latest version. So none of that ""pay for shipping"" the dead unit back to them, and we'll see what we can do run around. This alone, should convince you that it's worth buying this thermometer since we all know most of the hardware on Amazon is sourced from a giant factory making and selling units to other resellers. It's probably not a question of the difference in the label--it's a difference in the customer support and there, Alpha Grillers gets 5-stars. Accuracy and response Since I have the new unit, I wanted to see how accurate it was so I compared it to my Fluke 52 thermocouple thermometer with a Fluke 80PK-2A immersion probe that I had calibrated with a GE Druck DPI-822. I then filled a narrow mouth Pyrex 1,000ml flask with water from our hot water pot that had been set to 208 F and tried to hold both probe tips near each other in the hot water while trying to take a picture with the hand on a phone. The Fluke 52 and 80PK-2A read out at 184.4 while the Alpha Grillers displayed 184.1. As you know, water cools off fast and it's you don't uniform temperature in the container so the 0.3 degree difference could be the actual temperature difference from the probe positions in the hot water or even the probe shaft differences. Basically, the accuracy is excellent for a $20 meat thermometer. I also wanted to see how fast the Alpha Grillers unit responds so I filled a second small glass container with ice and water and recorded the display as it was dunked from the ice water back into the hot water (which had now cooled off further). You can watch the video above (it goes from removal from ice bath to hot water, and then back to ice bath and again back to the hot water) but it does respond extremely fast but not necessarily ""instant."" To be fair, ""instant"" is more of a marketing term and open to interpretation anyway. ""Instant"" coffee still takes time to add to water and stir for example. I'd say it takes about 3.5 seconds to respond to the ice bath to hot water--which is ""instant"" for most of us. For example, the Fluke 80PK-2A is far slower by design because it's a non-tapered, thicker, stainless immersion probe that absorbs a lot of the heat and can take a lot more abuse. The more slender tapered Alpha Grillers tapered tip is designed to pierce meat and also responds far quicker since you don't have to heat up a lot of metal. As far as the design of the unit, like the previous model, it features a hidden magnet to let you stick it to side of your grill which is a great feature, and the hole lets you hang it from a hook as well if your grill's hooks are large enough. The package also comes with four small hook and loop (Velcro) with adhesive on the back if you want to Velcro it to something. The new model's rubber buttons are also far easier to press than the previous design's plastic bubble-type. New to this model is very even white LED backlighting. Yes, it looks blue in the official marketing pictures but that's the digital camera color temperature at work--it's actually white. Hold function Also new is a hold, and min max function. The function is unlike most typical thermometers which typically cycle from room temperature to max temp and min temp. It's pretty thought out here for a meat thermometer. On the older model which doesn't have the old function, I would stick the thermometer in to the meat on the grill and twist my head over to see the current temp. On meat on the rear of the grill this means getting your head into odd angles and also pretty close to the grill. With the new model, you insert the probe, press the Hold button to activate the hold (it will display HOLD) and read the temp without all the head craning and heat on your face. Press Hold to release the hold function. One thing I want to point out: the UI for the hold function might be a little confusing because the hold function first requires that you turn on the hold function before you can use it. This occurs from off state to on. So like most, if you have it folded shut, and open to use, you will have to press the Hold button to turn on the mode. That means the first time you want to use it, you'll have to press it twice: Once to activate the hold mode, and once again to do the first hold. After its in its hold mode, it operates the way you expect it to: Into meat, Hold button to read, and Hold button to release. It doesn't turn off until the thermometer is switched off. Max Min Function The same Hold button also activates a max and min temp. This again is unlike the typical user interface of a temperature gauge with room temp / max / min cycle with a single click. To read the maximum temperature, you press and hold the Hold button for 3 seconds and it will display the maximum temperature with MAX in the display. Press again and will see the minimum recorded temperature since the unit was on and MIN in the display. One more press and you exit back into the standard mode. Note: you CANNOT the Max/Min function if it is currently in HOLD. You have to do this from the normal operations. Undocumented feature: Alpha Grillers' documentation say to clear the recorded max/min by turning the unit off (folding the thermometer shut) but if you are in the MAX or MIN mode, you can simply press and hold the Hold button for three seconds and it will reset both recorded max and min memories. Calibration Mode Unlike the 2017 mode, the 2020 version features a calibrate feature. On the button that lets you switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, pressing the button for 5 seconds will let you calibrate the unit. The instructions say to put the probe into a container of ice and water by using the Cal (f/c) button or the Hold button to set the calibration point to 32 degrees F or 0 degrees C. Obviously out of the box accuracy is excellent and for meat grilling do you really need this kind of accuracy or to even calibrate? I dunno. I was more afraid of accidentally pressing the calibrate button and throwing it out of whack so I went ahead and pressed the Cal button for 5 seconds which causes the display to show ""CALL"" (yes there's only one L in calibrate) but rather then letting me accidentally mess up the calibration, the thermometer displayed ""ERR"" and then went back into normal operation. My guess is the unit won't even let you calibrate it unless it's in an ice bath first so my worries about screwing up the calibration are pretty unlikely since you'd have to accidentally dunk it into an ice bath first. Build quality and battery Unlike the original Alpha Grillers I had which runs off of AAA, the new unit uses (which comes pre-installed) a CR2032 coin cell. I think this is an improvement as AAA kinda stink. They seem to be the most prone to leaking of all the cylinder cells I use (looking at you Kirkland). Lithium coin-cells, though more expsnsive, are more reliable, far less likely to leak (and ruin your unit) and operate at lower temperatures. The higher voltage also means more power for the the advanced functions in the unit too. I can't say anything about battery life as I haven't had the unit long enough, but I'm sure the LED backlight is the largest consumer of power so if you use it sparingly, it'll probably last quite a while. Water resistance Alpha Grillers calls it ""water proof"" and in the documentation, it's stated that you can ""fully submerge"" it in water for a short-time so long as the battery compartment is screwed on tightly. I didn't dunk my unit but I have no reason to doubt the water resistance of it. There are no visible screws anywhere on the unit and there is a gasket in the battery compartment (the gasket could be a little larger though to increase the seal as there are no ridges to mate with the gasket on the actual battery cover, just a flat surface). The only ingress of water would likely come through the gasket flattening over time or through the pivot point of the probe. The previous 2017 model used a small nub switch that the temperature probe boom depresses to switch off or on. This switch has moved to the inside of the unit which also adds to its water resistance. The probe boom itself is very stiff to open and close which also adds to water resistance. I have no idea how the probe is connected to actual controller board inside or how water resistant that is. The 2020 unit actually switches off at about a 45 degrees angle too which is an improvement over the 2017 model which required closing it firmly to switch off. I would often not switch off if you didn't close it correctly. I think this is plenty of water and dirt resistance for a meat thermometer unless you're a Navy Seal Griller who needs to scuba up from a sub before grilling on the beach. The main take away is you can probably leave this on your grill during inclement weather without worrying about it being killed. The previous model I had did not have any weather resistance claims and also no gasket in the battery compartment which might be how I killed it. Improvements Coming from the previous model, it's a big improvement but it's not without complaints. I think the Hold feature is great, but the button is too close to the temperature scale and backlight button. This means you have to angle your thumb to hit it straight on. You're also going to almost always hit that button from an angle which will put more stress on it over time. The other complaint is the hold button should be activated from power on without having to press it once. I suppose this is done to prevent someone from reading the wrong temperature but I'd rather have it on. Overall the 2020 model is a big improvement over the 2017 model. Currently it's quite a bit more expensive ($15 for 2017 model vs $20 for 2020 model) but I think the improvements are worth it. And let me again point out the customer service Alpha Grillers provides. My old one let go three and half years later and they stood behind it. For a $15 thermometer. Even if they didn't and they said, ""it's been three years bud,"" I'd buy another one with the improvements, accuracy and speed the new model has over the old one. And yes, I received this unit free, because my old unit died. Alpha Grillers sent it to me as a warranty replacement not to have it reviewed. It did not ask me to write my review, I did it because a company that stands behind its products deserves recognition and is worthy of my time spent.";Accurate, relatively fast and excellent customer service;real;real;B00S93EQUK;63;Home & Kitchen;Alpha Grillers Instant Read Meat Thermometer for Grill and Cooking.

I can confirm as it says in the instructions that you need to insert the probe from the side into the center of a steak or thin item, because the sensor is very sensitive and, if you stick it straight in from the top, you end up measuring the temperature of the pan rather than the meat. I've even used it to measure non-food items like the room air temperature and have been able to confirm its accuracy with another thermometer. With the touch of a button you can lock in the reading so you don't have to worry about it disappearing and there is a backlight feature which makes it very easy to see. You can get the readings in Celsius or Fahrenheit. It comes with a CR2032 battery already installed and also includes an extra one which is nice. The best part is that it comes with a Lifetime Warranty, so I hope it is the only thermometer I'll ever need.;Great all-purpose thermometer, can be used for food or taking room temperature;real;real;B00S93EQUK;63;Home & Kitchen;Alpha Grillers Instant Read Meat Thermometer for Grill and Cooking.

Sometimes it‚Äôll close on him while he‚Äôs drinking if he moves too much. One of us has to be there to hold it back for him, which kind of defeats the purpose.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c67;RRUBV8SLQQJC5;;2023-04-07;TRUE;B082MY2MX3;4.0;This was a purchase to replace a fan which had gotten incredibly loud over time, which was waking my husband up at night. It's a great fan -- the speeds are wonderful, the airflow is nothing short of brilliant, it's compact, almost noiseless. It fits on my nightstand nicely, and looks kind of sharp there as well! That all said, I'm taking off one star because of the control dial's placement. My previous fan was the same size as this new one, and the dial was on the top of the fan in a recess -- easily reachable, and I could adjust the fan and turn it off and on with one hand. This fan, however, isn't so easy to deal with. The dial is on the back of the fan, and I cannot seem to figure out how to manuever it easily with one hand. I have to either turn the fan (which means I need to not have other things around it or they'll get knocked off the nightstand), or stand up to get the leverage to turn the knob. Which is, of course, far from the end of the world, but in comparison to the ease of use I had with my previous fan, it's definitely an annoyance. I'm hoping that the dial loosens up over time. It's a wonderful fan except for that one unfortunate issue.;Everything I Needed;real;real;B082MY2MX3;65;Home & Kitchen;Amazon Basics 3 Speed Small Room Air Circulator Fan, 7-Inch Blade, Black;42777;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:33:23.304
644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c67;R36YQTHTQND8EQ;;2023-02-11;TRUE;B082MY2MX3;4.0;I bought this fan several times now. The first time was two years ago and it has been a great, powerful fan. Good size -- not too big, not too small. Reasonable price. Recently, I needed a similar one, so I went straight to Amazon to buy the same one. Got it, set it up... still works great, great price, etc. However, this time the dials were in a different order than the one I bought two years ago. The dial position immediately next to the off position on my two year old fan is power level 1, then next is power level 2, then three. So, off position then lowest blast power to highest blast power. This new one I bought, although it looks exactly the same and functions exactly the same as the original, goes from off position and then the next dial position is 3, then 2 then 1. So, it goes from off to the highest power level then on and on to the lowest power level. Not a big deal, I thought. But, as I've been using it, it has been quite annoying. The order does not make logical sense and when I use it, it feels like it should be in order from off to lowest to highest. Every time I want to get to the lowest blast, I have to flip through the super high blast and then middle blast. Not the end of the world, but annoying. It started to annoy me so much that I decided to try and buy another one, thinking this was a fluke that they accidentally made this one out of order. I figured if the new one comes in the right order, I'll return this one. Sadly, the new one came in the bad order again. So, I guess this is how they are making it now. That's why I took off one star. It still works well and for the low price, I didn't want to try and find a different fan that's more expensive just to get the dials in the right order. But, very annoying.;Works great, but dials are in strange order;real;real;B082MY2MX3;65;Home & Kitchen;Amazon Basics 3 Speed Small Room Air Circulator Fan, 7-Inch Blade, Black;42777;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:33:23.304

Put it back together and it made noise again. Opened it up and saw how the brackets holding the fan shaft and motor where placed, moved them a bit and noise went away and fan is good. It is a design flaw in the bracket. The inside of the bracket needs filed down because the mold has a flaw which over time will allow metal on metal contact if the fan gets dust and moves the shaft even a little. If you have the same issue you can get a dremel or file and fix it. Once you open the cover and remove the two screws holding the shaft you will see what I mean.

I'm that person who has difficulty sleeping without noise and a fan blowing cool air in my face, so finding a good fan is very important. I had been using a Holmes Blizzard fan for the past five years and it finally quit on me a month ago. I loved this fan but didn't want to spend the $ for another one since it had increased significantly since purchasing in 2018; therefore, I began searching for a new fan that was just as good but less costly. After a few poor purchases, I found the Amazon Basic 3-speed fan and couldn't be happier! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this fan (which was more than half the cost of the Blizzard). It is just loud enough to help me sleep (but still quiet enough for my hubby to get a good night's rest) and the amount of air it produces at each speed is perfect. It's easy to adjust the direction of air flow and could easily cool an entire small room, if necessary.

Opening the box left me skeptical. They are so thin that, folded and packed in a plastic sleeve, I thought there was only one curtain. The whole time I was installing the rod and lining things up, I was sure it wouldn't do the job. Then I drew them closed and watched a room bombarded by sun go dark. Now obviously not pitch black, but short of boarding the window up it would not be possible to get better results from a normal ring and rod style curtain. Functionally I have zero complaint. Style wise, they are simple but nice. Somehow, they shed coarse dog hair easily with little effort to dislodge it. Literally the only negative I can offer is that, if you are right next to the curtain and in intense direct sunlight, you can see a few pinholes here and there where tiny specks of light are visible. As far as cons go, they don't get much smaller. On the fence? Measure your space, account for about 5 inches of lost space per curtain due to folds etc, and order this set of curtains.;You Want Dark?

For starters, I thought only one came in a pack‚Ä¶these are a 2 pack so right away I was pleasantly surprised. They fit my daughter‚Äôs room windows perfectly, blacked out the light so she can sleep later than 7 am on the weekends since her windows face east, and matched the curtains for her closets. They are light-weight (important in my case since the rod I have can‚Äôt hold much weight), still have enough weight to them so that they hang straight, and are wrinkle-free so I was able to hang them up right out of the package. They also have just the right amount of shine to the fabric and look high end. I‚Äôll definitely purchase this brand again if I need more curtains.;Great blackout curtains!

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c68;R3IQHPZHEK70XV;;2023-02-10;TRUE;B01CS31NV6;5.0;"These curtains are pretty good IMO. They have nice metal grommets and the material feels decent. Mine are still creased a bit in places from the way they are folded and packed. I sprayed them with water and tumbled them in the dryer for a little bit to try to get rid of the creases, and it did get rid of them a bit, but not totally. Perhaps if I ironed them it would rid the creases completely. I kinda figured they'll unwrinkle over time from hanging and I'm not too worried about it as the wrinkles/creases are much less noticeable now. We'll see. Also, it's only been about 14 dats since they've been installed/hung. Now on to some other info. I bought these because I work nights and live in central Florida, and my room is obviously quite bright during the day. Particularly in the winter months as the sun is to the south in the sky and one of my rooms windows faces the south. I already have horizontal slat blinds that have been installed for almost 2 years now and they cut down some on the sunlight entering, but not that much. Honestly, I don't really have a problem sleeping with the brightness, but my girlfriend does when she comes over and crashes with me during the day, so I figured I'd install some curtains, for her sake. Right now it's about 2:30pm on a sunny day and I took some pics to show the amount of light they cut down. I have the grey ones and they definitely cut down the light a ton, but they are not ""black out"" IMO, but that's fine with me. See the attached photos. One pic shows the curtains closed and also the horizontal slat blinds behind them are closed. Another pic shows with curtains open and slat blinds closed. The last pic shows with curtains and slat blinds open. It is a significant reduction in brightness with these curtains and the slat blinds.";Satisfied;real;real;B01CS31NV6;66;Home & Kitchen;NICETOWN Thermal Insulated Grommet Blackout Curtains for Bedroom (2 Panels, W42 x L63 -Inch, Grey);105556;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:33:31.184

The big question you probably have is would you buy it again? Yes. This has been our nighty sleeper since purchased. We rotated the bed every three months. The wife has been very very happy with the bed as a back sleeper. She praises the deep, relaxing sleep almost every day. Around the 6 month mark, as a side sleeper, I started to have deep pressure points on my hips. I would move around a little and be fine, but I could feel the residual pain later in the day. That's where I'm at. Meh. I've finally gotten to the point where I'm looking at another mattress in the next year. Wifey doesn't know this yet because she's super happy with the bed. I am too, but I want a better sleep. I miss the deep sleep I had the first few months. These beds are perfect for growing kids or a guest bedroom. That's why I say I would purchase another, because I will for that application. **** I wanted to make sure I put some thought into this review as I was once just like you. I was on the fence about buying a bed from Amazon. If your reading this, good job trying to educate yourself on this purchase! There are THOUSANDS of positive reviews on this bed and as of 5/19/17 mine is one of them. I set a Google calander reminder to update this review 6 months from today. The wife and I purchased the Zinus 14"" metal platform (no headboard) instead of using our old boxspring. We wanted to have the extra bed available in case we had over night guests. The bed frame was easy enough to put together, I'm pretty sure its only 20 wing nuts and bolts. I took the additional step of brushing thread sealant on the bolts to reduce the possiblity of *squeeks* and vibration as other reviewers have suggested. Unboxing the mattress was pretty straight forward. I watched a few Youtube videos and I suggest you do the same. Carefully cut the tape on the cardboard box and dump out the big heavy white bag. The mattress itself is inside the white plastic bag that you rip open once you have the bag on the frame. Repeat. Open once you have the bag on the frame. DO NOT CUT THE WHITE BAG, RIP IT ALONG THE SEAM! Align the mattress on the frame and remove the clear plastic bag. Once the bed is completely removed from the packaging, measure the mattress thickness, do another alignment, pull the corners up toward you if they are folded under and start the clock. I purchased the bed set in early April and the temperature wasn't exactly warm. As other reviewers have done, I brought in a small space heater to warm up the room. This seemed to help expand the foam faster and uniformly. After 2 hours the mattress was about 8 inches and I went to work leaving this project until later in the evening. Upon returning home, I found the bed had expanded to 11 1/2 inches! I was very tempted to sleep on the bed that night but my wife reminded me that I shouldn't ruin our new bed. ...a total of 36 hours have gone by... The wife has agreed that the bed is now ready to sleep on! I measured the thickness of the bed in 4 different locations all of which were over 12 inches. I'd say our bed has expanded to 12 1/4 inches! There didn't seem to be any visible dips or lumps in the mattress. I'm 6'4"" 235lbs side sleeper, wifey is 5'9"" 130lbs back sleeper and both found the bed to be very comfortable. I did not find the bed to be ""marshmallow"" soft, but more on the medium soft/firm level. Is this a complaint? Nope. If you've never slept on a memory foam mattress there is a bit of getting used to. It's not bad, the bed just doesn't react like a tradtional boxspring would. I was shocked at how well my wife and I both slept that night. Yes, there are a few days to acclimate yourself to this bed so don't jump into it expecting the magic floating marshmallow unicorn will usher you off to the deepest sleep you ever had on the first rainbow star lit night of spring. Did I sleep incredibly well the first few nights? You friggen bet Mr. Lahey! Regarding heat... I read where others had to change how they layered the bed sheets/comforter and will agree with that. While this bed is not HOT it is warm so you may have to rethink having 6 layers of bed sheets. I sleep hot, but once I rethought my bedding heat was no longer an issue. For people wondering how this bed handles adult fun play time I wouldn't worry. The wife and I made sure to diligently test this aspect of mattress performance and are happy to report... neither of us really noticed a difference. Our only real complaint was more with the bed frame than the mattress. There are no grooves/slots/tabs to secure the mattress to the frame or vice versa. Hence, the bed can move if your really really into adult fun play time. I can say after a solid month of sleeping on this bed that it's amazing. I wake up rested, no hip pain, and groggy from the mass amount of REM sleep I just experienced. Only time will tell how this mattress holds up. Right now, it fit the bill and our budget. I will update everyone in 6 months.";Still happy I made this purchase;real;real;B01MR51N1S;67;Home & Kitchen;Zinus 6 Inch Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress / CertiPUR-US Certified / Bed-in-a-Box / Pressure Relieving, Twin, White;146094;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:33:39.414
644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;R5NWCE4HIZAYB;;2022-10-29;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;5.0;I purchased this mattress when I purchased my house 8 years ago. I had been sleeping on a 20 year old spring king size mattress. I have the 12‚Äù Green Tea version. King. I am a 36 year old side sleeper who weighs 140 lbs. My wife is a 27 year old side and back sleeper who weighs around 250 lbs. I have the pleasure of being able to tell you how this mattress compares with a Zinus 8‚Äù cooling gel mattress and a 10‚Äù Green Tea mattress. In the 8 years I have owned this 12‚Äù mattress not a lot has changed. It has broken in but not down. It is noticeably less firm than the other mattresses without being considered not firm. There are no lumps, dips, divets or sunken in spots. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. In fact I know 6 other people who have purchased this mattress solely because they house sat my dogs for me while on vacation and slept in my bed. So let‚Äôs break it down: I purchased the mattress and it came tightly rolled and compressed in a bag that was in a box. I dragged the box to my spare bedroom and dumped it out. I rolled the plastic with the bed in it out and carefully pulled the plastic away from the mattress before carefully cutting along the seam in a quick motion with a box cutter. It immediately began to inflate. I pulled the plastic complete off and left it on the guest room floor. At the time I had just purchased the house. The carpet was clean and the only other item in the room were 3 moving boxes. I opened the 2 windows in the room. It was spring in SC so about 80 degrees. I left the room and continued to clean and unpack. I checked on the mattress about 6 hours later and it looked fully inflated. The room had a smell. It was very light and smelled like new foam as to be expected. I went along and plucked at the corners which were all still not fully up. Left the room and cleaned. I checked in it again before going to bed that night. The bed looked fully inflated, including the corners. I did not touch it. I went to bed and left it alone until that next night giving it almost a full 48 hours. I dragged my old mattress out of my room that night and leaned it against a wall in the spare room and then with the help of my then girlfriend, took the new mattress and placed it on my bed frame. (Which is an adjustable bed frame. More on that later.) there was no longer a smell. I grabbed my old sheets which fit on it perfectly even though this mattress is 12‚Äù and my old one was 6‚Äù. Grabbed my comforter and pillows and me, my girlfriend and 35 lb Australian cattle dog Beaux and 6 lb chihuahua Wiggles lay down. Heaven. I was 28 and weighed 115 lbs at that time. I had hurt my back at work tripping over a cord while carrying a heavy load when I was 23. My back had never been the same. For the first time in 5 years I lay on that mattress and no longer felt the pressure in my back. Or the constant searing pain. I do not sink into it. It‚Äôs by no means cloud like or marshmallow plush. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being most firm and wooden plank like and 10 being marshmallow soft where you sink and get trapped this is a 3-4. It relieves pressure points but isn‚Äôt hard. I don‚Äôt bend when I lay on it but can feel my hip and shoulder go in. I don‚Äôt get very hot on it and I‚Äôm a very hot, very light restless sleeper. Any movement, light, sound, breathing will wake me up. Basically I‚Äôm just really bad at sleeping. It‚Äôs very good at not transferring movement so my girlfriend could roll or move and I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. When I bought the mattress I also got a waterproof cover because Wiggles was 14 and had seizures. Sometimes he would wet himself during the seizures so the protector could protect the mattress. It doesn‚Äôt crinkle and you can‚Äôt feel it, but even 8 years later the mattress looks like the day I drug it onto the bed. It bends on an adjustable base but is thick enough that it doesn‚Äôt bend all the way. The base also vibrates to massage your back. I can feel it through the mattress as well though it is very dampened. Sexy time is no different on this than with a spring mattress. You don‚Äôt sink in, there is less bounce and no squeaky springs. Fast forward to 2020. The pandemic. I am now 34 and weigh 155 lbs. mattress still feels and looks the same even with weight gain. No bumps or lumps and not hot, unless it‚Äôs summer but no matter what mattress you have you‚Äôre gonna be hot when it‚Äôs 106 degrees outside and the ac on your 102 barely insulated house is struggling. My spare room is no longer empty with just 3 boxes. It‚Äôs now a whole guest room. And it also has a Zinus bed frame and 10‚Äù green tea mattress. 10‚Äù compared to 12‚Äù is a little bit on the firmer side. Now a 2-3 on that scale from earlier. Still pressure relieving but motion transfers a little more. Beaux was testing it out with me and rolled and I could feel the bed jump. Guests still absolutely love it and talk about buying one. I always take them to my room so they can lay on mine and tell me if they feel a difference. They always end up choosing the 12‚Äù and buy it for their home. I have slept on the cooling foam Zinus mattress at 8‚Äù at my mother in laws house. It is not noticeably cooler but IS noticeably firmer. A 1.5 on that scale from earlier. Just shy of being a wooden plank. I was stiff the next day and my shoulders and torn back muscle aches. My advice is to go thicker on the mattress no matter your weight. Gives more pressure relief without giving you the sink. My mattress at 12‚Äù is by no means not firm but it‚Äôs also pressure relieving and not rock like. It‚Äôs now October 29th 2022. I‚Äôm 36 and weigh 140. Wiggles is no longer with us but the mattress cover and Beaux remain. Stryker the 50 lb Australian cattle dog has joined us. I write this review at 8:09 am, laying on the mattress. I slept for 7.5 hours and have no pains, stiffness or aches. I feel well rested. My wife is slightly snoring and just rolled a little and I barely felt it and only because I was awake to notice. I highly recommend this mattress and will replace it with another one exactly like it at the 10 year mark if it feels like it needs to be replaced. It doesn‚Äôt feel any different than the day I bought it now though. Maybe the 12-15 year mark if that‚Äôs the case.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;RP2N0CP5KPICN;;2018-01-30;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;4.0;I ordered this item on 1-27-2018 it arrived on 1-29-2018 with my prime membership. I opened and laid it out on top of a guest room bed to inflate. In 4 hours it appeared to be fully inflated. However packing info says wait 24-48 hours before using to allow proper time to inflate. I did however break down and climb on to see how it feels. I am on a pillow top mattress currently that is roughly 6-8 years old and has been causing me a lot of pain in my shoulder and hip as I am a side sleeper. Just laying on this bed for a few minutes its much firmer than my current bed, and so very comfortable. I will leave a more through review once I have actually slept in it for a few nights. I can say I am very excited. I plan to put it on my current box springs, and we will see how it goes. I was a bit disappointed to realize you cant flip the mattress only rotate it, which is what I have currently with my terrible pillow top . and I like to flip my mattresses every month. I will also state that when I unrolled it I was really worried about it forming its natural state as it had a lot of weird lumps from packing, but it has formed to a normal mattress already on a cursory view of it on my way out the door today. I will better inspect it when moving it to my actual bed. Update!! I have been sleeping on this mattress for about a week now. I will say one night I did get very warm, however I don't think it was my mattress I tend to run hot and cold and occasionally has the same issue with my old pillow top. This mattress is shockingly firm when you first sit or lay on it you think oh Hell No! But within second the memory foam begins to contour to your body and it's very comfortable. I am a side sleeper and was having alot of hip pain with my old mattress. While my pain isn't gone it's much better, and I think it will go away given more time with this new bed. My review is definitely a positive one. For 179$ and arriving in 2 days I'm very pleased. Included are 3 photos the last photo shows me sitting on the edge of the bed showing how much it goes down with my weight, and that I don't know why people say you can't sit on the sides I can't sit on any side any corner no issues... and even with my weight it springs right back to shape once I move or get up, it also still provides comfort and support this bed is rated up to 500lbs! Which thankfully I am not! ********* Updated Review*********** I have been sleeping on this bed for over a month now, and wanted to update my thoughts. My hip and shoulder were in ALOT of pain when I bought my new mattress. I couldn't barely walk around during the day from the pain, now I am fully recovered and I credit my bed for this. If you are on a budget and cant spend 500-1000$ on a new mattress I greatly recommend this item. If you are plus sized and worried about it don't be this bed is tested for 500lbs and as a big girl myself I sleep amazing on it with my HUGE dog and cat. I feel more rested and relaxed waking than I have in at least 5 years.;So far so good. ****Updated Review after a month or more of use;real;real;B01MR51N1S;67;Home & Kitchen;Zinus 6 Inch Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress / CertiPUR-US Certified / Bed-in-a-Box / Pressure Relieving, Twin, White;146094;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:33:39.414
644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;R17PPO7I459WWW;;2018-05-12;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;5.0;"Received it 4 days ago. Got here fast.Intact and packaged well. Got it opened up and cut/broke the seal and poof! Within 24 hours it was totally filled and looked great. Corners were sharp and defined. The firmness was consistent and I was pleasantly surprised when I gave it a 2 minute test drive. It really is better than I expected. My test drive would have been much longer if not for the 1 ""catch"" in all of this. The odor is pungent to the point of only being able to tolerate it 5 or 7 minutes. It is not a mold or chemical smell. I have since had a total of 7 people,(delivery men),bring furniture into the apartment. I said nothing about it and waited. I watched for there reactions. All of which were almost immediate and commented on in vivid detail as they compared the odor to sources I won't go into for sake of ""Too much info!"". They never physically stepped into the bedroom. I have sealed up the return vent and basically sealed the room off with a small fan at first. I have now moved up to a good size fan and the 2 large windows are opened round the clock.. That said I have every intention of following up with an update in the next few days. Hence the 3 stars. I had already factored in time for something like this after reading the reviews. The manufacturer recommended 72 hours. I had figured on 5 or 6 days into my plans. While I am concerned I am really hoping things will level out and the odor will dissipate. As I had mentioned this mattress really looks and feels great. Things like this often turn around completely and all is fine. I feel optimistic for 2 good reasons. #1: I bought it from AMAZON and #2:from my research the manufacturer is focused on customer satisfaction almost as much as AMAZON is. In the meantime check back in a few days. I am definitely going to follow up on this. I am just as curious as any one else who is looking at this mattress. Tune in later... UPDATE: 5/14/18 Day 6 and fan(s) continue to run 24hrs round the clock.Am very concerned but still hopeful. Most unsettling is that the odor has not dissipated AT ALL! It remains pungent to the point of picking up the odor downstairs and outside that side of the garage. Spoke with Zinus customer service. Had no problem getting through to associate. Explained issue and asked for possible ideas. She suggested that I might try some dryer sheets and continue to air it out for another week if possible. I asked if putting it outdoors in a protected place would help. She said yes but don't do it if it was too difficult for me. She was sincerely concerned that I would risk hurting myself in moving it outside.She told me that she would like me to call them back in a week to let her know how things were going. She said if things have not improved by then we would discuss an exchange. Something I REALLY hope doesn't happen but I think it is important to point out that even with all this hassle I feel it would be worth the trouble. Only because outside of the terrible odor, every other characteristic of this mattress is (at the price), is quite remarkable. I feel the associate I spoke with was not handing me a line and that she was in fact sincere. She meant what she said. So I guess time will tell. I will continue to give updates.(another first for me with AMAZON but worth the effort). A good 75% of my purchasing decisions on AMAZON ride on the reviews. I know they take them seriously only because at times in the past, when I have discussed a return with them directly, the process involved the validity of some of the reviews I had read during the decision making of a purchase. Over the years they have been consistent with their efforts and bent over backwards to make things right the few times there was this type of issue. What makes this so unique for me is the SIZE of the item we are dealing with and my inability to ""shrink"" it back to it's shipping size. I'm off to the laundry room for some dryer sheets and as before I'll be updating this possibly in the next few days, but definitely in a week. I am still concerned but trying to remain positive and stay focused on a good outcome.. UPDATE: 5/25/2018 Just over 10 days since last update. Wanted to make sure. Kept up with the fans and per instructions, the dryer sheets. Was really getting discouraged by the 6th day so I called Zinus. Call went through first try and was on hold less than 5 minutes. Gave info to the associate and she had my history up in no time. She had enough so I didn't have to start from the beginning,(thank goodness). Told her exactly what I had done and let her know my concerns and frustration. It became clear that she was in fact listening to what I was telling her. She could see in the notes that I had been in contact with both Amazon and Zinus during this time with the status of things. She was never once dismissive. Her answers were direct and honest. She made it clear that enough time had passed and it was time to begin the process of replacement. Her only request was that I contacted Amazon once more and tell them about our discussion and that I did in fact need and qualify for a replacement. She told me to see if Amazon would agree with handling the exchange and that if there was any""push back"" on there part,(which she doubted), to go the the Zinus web site, click on a particular link and start the replacement""Ticket"" process. At that point it was made very clear to me this was not a hand off, and that every thing was going to be taken care of. It was just a question of which one was going to do it. I called the Amazon number she gave me. In less than 10 minutes every detail was taken care of and an extra minute was taken to make sure I knew everything was going to be fine and every concern had been addressed and eliminated. 4 days later the replacement arrived. The minute I broke the seal I knot only knew it was OK, it smelled GREAT! Seriously... Less than 24 hours later the filling out process was complete and just like the first, the corners were sharp and defined. Last measurement was 11 7/8 inches. I think it is safe to say I will make it through the rest of my life and be fine with the knowledge of having lost that 1/8 if an inch. I feel it necessary to mention some of the negative reviews directed toward the customer support of both Amazon and Zinus. I will be honest about the hassle factor in all of this. To say it has not been would be a blatant lie. I was just as upset as anyone who found themselves in this dilemma and I made it clear to all I spoke with. However, NEVER once did I tear into anyone I spoke with or feel it necessary to do so. Even given the amount of time I spent. Heck, this darn review has taken a chunk of time but the reason I am doing this is the very reason I come to Amazon. They have never failed to be fair and honest with any return/exchange issue. I have found if I am honest and reasonable with any Amazon associates they take care of it every time. The few and rare times I have had an issue with one of their suppliers Amazon has stepped in, usually before I even ask, and bent over backwards to make sure things were not just dealt with, but that it was done to MY satisfaction. Over the years Amazon has proven to be consistent in all issues similar to this one. Say what you will but in my 61 years on this earth I have never had the ongoing support focused totally on the consumer from any retailer at a level comparable to what Amazon provides. If something goes wrong, they do everything they can to fix it. What more can you ask for?

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;R3MFKR5F8O1UE0;;2023-04-04;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;5.0;I was skeptical, but this is the PERFECT mattress‚Ä¶ even for person with MAJOR spine impairments! üòÉ I bought it for my mom‚Äôs guest room so that I had a good mattress to sleep on when I visited her for 2 weeks. I visit her a few times a year, so I didn‚Äôt hesitate spending a few hundred - since the old soft matress in her guest room absolutely KILLED my back the last time I visited her! üò¢ MY BACKGROUND: I had a failed back surgery (L5-S1 artificial disc replacement) üò© in 2015 and resulting WORSE spine issues including degenerative discs, a herniated disc, facet arthrosis, scoliosis, & spondylosis. NEEDLESS to say I DO NOT recommend lumbar artificial disc replacement surgery. üò¨ Unfortunately, I had to quit my job & go on disability. üò¢ And I can‚Äôt really travel anymore because of my pain in cars and due to the uncertainty of mattresses at hotels. Anyway, long story short‚Ä¶ I can only sleep on a VERY specific type of mattress. It has to be reasonably firm / supportive of my fragile unstable spine, yet reasonably soft on top as I am mostly a side sleeper (sometimes back). For my own house, I tried 5 different expensive mattress through Macys and other stores & returned them all as they caused pain / didn‚Äôt effectively support my spine. I finally ended up buying an AMAZING tempurpedic hybrid (medium firmness) proadapt mattress for my house, which I also HIGHLY recommend - literally best decision of my life, (but only if you have $6,000 to spend)! ü•∫ I opened a credit card. I‚Äôd rate my temperpedic a 10/10 and the Zinus 12 Inch Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress a strong 9/10! ü§© Slept like a rock, and best of all when I woke up I was not in debilitating pain to the point I could hardly walk or move. And my elderly mother was able to remove it from the box and put it on the bed herself! The only thing keeping me from rating it a 10 is that after a week, there was a small indentation/ compression spot where I slept. However, somehow (surprisingly) it didn‚Äôt change the comfort level or cause any back pain. SO JUST BUY IT - it is freaking AMAZING for the price, support, and comfort. And comparable to a very expensive tempurpedic mattess. Thank you to this WONDERFUL company. üòçüëèüèª PS. Also, if you are still hesitant, the return policy with amazon is great! I did an online chat with amazon and was told that I could return the mattress and wouldn‚Äôt have to try and fit it back in the box. They said I would just have to call Amazon about the return and set up a pick up date for them to come pick up the unwrapped matress from my moms house. U can even ask them yourself through the online chat (take screen shots so u have proof!) It‚Äôs a no brainer to try this matress out! Your welcome.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;RSLH9QHDCAXGK;;2017-07-21;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;5.0;"Purchased on 7/12/17 for $189. Had a sinking feeling in my gut all week because of negative reviews on Amazon. I've only slept on the bed two nights now, but I feel like something is going on here that's just not right. Let's talk about the smell, I have seen a lot of complaints comparing it to the smell of ""wet paint"", I find that comparison absolutely disingenuous. There is an odor, it's the smell of new foam. I would say on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the strongest, this odor falls in in at about 2 or 3. After 24-48 hours, I would say it is a 1 or less. I can't smell it unless I'm face down in the mattress with the sheets off inhaling deeply. Just for the reader's reference, I have painted a handful of bedrooms. The odor of wet paint registers as a strong 7 out of 10 to me. Also, just a side note -- the instructions recommended I open the bed in a well ventilated area, I opened it in my room with the air conditioner on. Everything was fine. The instructions also recommended I wait 48 hours before sleeping on the bed, so I did. Even though it appeared to be 90% expanded in 5-7 minutes, I gave it two days anyway. My first impression of the bed is that it is firm, very firm. It's definitely a lot different than the 20 year old box spring I was sleeping on. But wow, after a full day at work and breaking the old bed down/putting this one together I got right to sleep. The foam contoured to my body and I woke up feeling pretty good the next morning. There was no feeling of ecstasy, I didn't wake up with some remarkable experience and I'm not in love with it, but I did wake up feeling pretty darn good. Also I did sleep all night without tossing/turning, which is a big plus. The second big complaint that concerned me was in regard to sinking into the mattress and having difficulty turning side to side because of sinking. I haven't experienced this, as of this moment those claims are completely unfounded. I'm 6'1 and 315 pounds, I can easily turn from side to side even after the foam contours to my body. I don't understand this complaint, at best I would say it is exaggerated. The bed in a box market is extremely volatile right now, a handful of companies are competing with one another in a relatively new market. I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist, but something about the hate this bed is receiving just doesn't seem right. Looks like there's a lot of exaggeration going on, but I can only comment on my experience. I included a picture of the bed, apologies for the mess... the comforter set I ordered won't be in for another day. Also apologies for my roommates, who occasionally just come in my room and get in the bed. I guess they will be buying one of their own soon. I will edit this review around October 2017 and update with more information. Just felt I had a responsibility to clear some things up about the bed. EDIT: Update as of 11/27/17. I'm a month late on my promised update. This mattress has survived a move to a new home. I have slept on it every night and it hasn't given an inch. It's still holding up extremely well, I am fully satisfied with my purchase. I see the overwhelmingly negative 1 star reviews are still pouring in on this product, it doesn't make sense to me. It MUST be under attack by competitors, no idea how else to explain it. I would buy this mattress again and again, and I have recommended it to everyone who has asked about it. I have met a few people who own them, and they love them as well. This is the bed-in-a-box killer at a price other companies would charge you for a single pillow. Buy it. EDIT 2 ( 4/29/2018): I just got back from my parents house, who purchased two of these mattresses after I shared my experience. They tried to put one of them on a traditional bed-frame with a box spring and experienced significant sinking. I am going to equate this problem to the reviews left by other Amazon customers on this item. If you try to put this mattress on a traditional box spring, you are going to have a bad time. You need to purchase the Zinus frame, or a similar generic frame made for a memory foam mattress to go with this item.";Pretty good deal!

We have now had this mattress for just over 3 months and still love it. I am falling asleep faster, staying asleep and waking up feeling more rested. I have slept on both sides and even in the middle of the mattress and have equal comfort anywhere. I normally have 3 dogs hogging the bed and what's really nice is I barely notice if they get up and move to a new spot, even if it's right next to me. I no longer feel like my husband is doing backflips if he turns over in the middle of the night either. Even the one night the mattress pad didn't make it into the dryer in time for bed I did notice the difference the mattress pad makes in not making this mattress feel as firm, but it was still quite comfortable, just not as comfortable. I have no complaints. There were no smells with ours to start with so that never was a problem and it's still at a full 12"" evenly across. I'm in the camp of those who were really skeptical of buying a mattress online. Especially a foam one since I've had a regular pillow top one for the past 10 years. Yes it was time for a new mattress! I had been shopping around for a new mattress for a few months trying out different ones, getting pricing and trying to make a decision which is kind of a big deal when you're more than likely looking at spending a lot of money. A friend suggested we consider the foam mattresses and that Amazon had some good prices on them. I headed to a local store to give their version of these mattresses a try and I was surprised how comfortable they were. After testing them out I decided to see what Amazon reviews had to say about the ones they offered. I read through the good and the not so good and the flat out bad reviews and decided to take a chance and see what arrived. I am super happy I did! Granted it's only been 2 weeks but so far we love this mattress! I had read the multiple reviews saying theirs didn't inflate correctly, had a foul odor, was lumpy, etc....thankfully none of that was true of what we received. To break it down..... cons... It is a firm mattress no doubt. I am someone who likes to pretty much sleep in a cloud and am a side sleeper so it's taken some getting used to. Since the cost of this mattress was so good I went ahead and ordered a high quality mattress cover/pad and for me it's really helped make adjusting going from a plush pillow top to a firm bed a lot easier. Going from a spring mattress to a foam ones takes some adjustment on the support on the sides. Obviously the spring ones tend to have more of a frame around the edges so sitting on the side of the bed is different. I wouldn't say it's bad but it's not as supportive. We will probably need to get a new bed frame here sometime soon. While the box springs we had from our old king are still in great shape the lighter weight mattress tends to slide and needs to be shoved back into place every night before going to bed. Not really any fault of the mattress it's just a con that I'll need to replace the bed itself in order to stop this from happening. Another con that's not the fault of the mattress it's just my bad luck....I missed where this was on sale just after Thanksgiving because I was still pondering what kind of mattress to get. So I paid the higher, yet still on sale, price. 4 days later it went back on sale again and has remained $40 cheaper for over a week now. Bummer for me, but still a good deal, just not as good of a deal as if I'd waited 4 more days to decide. On to the good stuff Pros..... Per my experience I say buy this mattress. Don't wait, grab it at the price it is now. I did not notice any sort of foul odor but I did open the windows and had the ceiling fan going while it inflated. It inflated to the full 12"" and did so within an hour. We were sleeping on the mattress withing 4 hours of setting it up. It fit where our old king size was perfectly with no overhang or shortages size wise. It's around 2"" taller than our old mattress so that took a little getting used to but it measured 12"" with a regular school ruler. It was well packaged and fully deflated ready to go when it arrived. I'm a big girl and my husband is a fairly big guy and we both sleep comfortably on this mattress with our 3 large breed bed hogging dogs. When my husband moves at night he does so like a fish out of water and I have noticed he doesn't wake me up turning over because it's not bouncing me around like our old mattress did. I don't even really notice a dog moving around to a different spot. I'm a side sleeper who would love to sleep in a cloud so this did take some getting used to but it's never been uncomfortable. The first night getting to sleep and finding a comfortable position took a little bit but I could instantly feel I was better supported and my hip and shoulder didn't have the pressure it normally would. When I turned onto my back I felt almost like I was sleeping in a hammock. Not totally of course but the extra support was there where it hadn't been before. With what I saved on the mattress I went ahead and bought a nice mattress pad/cover to put on top to make it a little more soft. I had always been told you can make a firm mattress more soft but you can't make a soft mattress more firm so if it's too firm invest in a good pad and it can make a lot of difference if you prefer a softer bed. What I noticed right away is when I woke up I wasn't as sore. I feel a lot more rested in the morning and I'm not waking up to turn over or move around near as much as I was. Granted our old mattress was 10 years old and that had a lot to do with it, but still this mattress is obviously better and keeps me in a deep sleep for longer periods throughout the night. My husband also says he's sleeping better and isn't flopping around like he had been doing with the old mattress. He's the one of us always complaining about being hot while sleeping and he said he hasn't noticed this mattress makes that any worse, and if anything since he's not moving around so much it's better. We like it so much we plan to order the 8"" version for our kid's bunk bed here soon. As we get more use of out this I will try to update this review for how it's holding up. I don't expect to get 10 years out of it, granted i probably shouldn't have tried to get 10 years out of the older one but it held up for at least 8-9 of those years. For this price I'd be happy if it lasts a couple of years. If it lasts longer even better. I highly suggest if this is too firm for you to buy a nice mattress pad and to buy it while it's at the price it is now.";Great mattress.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;R3LGORR96QQYZO;;2017-02-07;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;5.0;"I bought the 12"" memory foam 'green tea' bed and all I can seem to say lately is... oh bed, I love you. I was used to sleeping on a very old tempur bed that had been breaking down over the past year. it was basically like sleeping on a hot lumpy sponge and I was waking up with a sore back after only about 4 hours of sleep. So I decided to upgrade myself. I did my research, spent three days talking to mattress stores, reading reviews and talking to people who had bought different beds. I tested beds, I checked prices, I looked at options, everything. I wanted to make sure I was buying a good bed that wouldn't leave me in agony like my old bed. I knew two people who'd bought beds from this company. So, I looked at all the options they offered and what they were made of and how people reviewed them. I ended up choosing the 12 inch memory foam green tea one. The price was right, and shipping wasn't terrible. I expected to get my bed in about a week... which would give me time to prepare to set it up. I got my bed in about 3 days from the point I submitted my order. I decided not to buy the bedframe they offer, as I still had my box from my last mattress. I kinda wish I'd bought their frame, as it sits higher than my current frame, but that's beside the point. I got everything set and ready to go, and opened my box. My mother laughed at the fact that a bed came in that small of a box and she was skeptical of it's quality. I was a bit cautious, but felt confident in my choice. The bed is a bit difficult to get out of the box, and then the bag that it comes in. I can't see anyone being able to do so alone. once out of it's shipping bag, it's still sealed and fairly easy to just situate on the frame before opening. I highly recommend you don't unseal the mattress until you have it where you want it. once I cut into the plastic seal wrap, it instantly started to 'inflate' again. got the plastic pulled off of it and watched as within moments it was already filling out. There was barely any smell to it at all. I left my window cracked open just a bit that night just in case, but honestly, unless I had pressed my face up against it, I couldn't smell anything from it. I followed the instructions that came with it (yes, they send you instructions and care information) and I let it be for the remainder of that day, that night, and the following day. In total I think I left it just lay there and settle for about 30 hours. I'm extremely glad I did because it allowed the foam to expand to 11.75 inches. I wasn't gonna complain about the loss of a quarter of an inch. So i finally got to lay down on my bed! The top layer of the bed is so nice and squishy that you don't even take notice that there's hard foam in the base layers. this nice super squishy top layer of foam makes the bed totally conform to you. the layer just under that is the typical memory foam, so even after the squishy foam sinks in, you've got regular memory foam to support you. If you sit on the edge it does sink in (but that's perfectly normal of any sort of foam edge) but as soon as you get up you can see it just fluff right back up. it's actually kinda fun to push down on it and watch how quick it recovers. you can kinda 'see' where the layers are when you look at the side. It comes with a nice cover, but when you're first looking it over, some of the layers aren't cut exactly to match at the sides. this didn't trouble me as once the sheets were on, you can't even tell. Oh yeah... for the 12 inch, buy deep pocket sheets. I got sheets with pockets up to 14"", and they fit just perfectly. I'm a side and back sleeper... so having a bad bed is like a cruel form of daily torture. This bed... oh man, this bed is great for side and back sleeping. I've gained over an hour of restful sleep each night, and I find I don't toss and turn as much. . my dog even loves this bed. she has her own bed to sleep on, but I still find her constantly sleeping in a corner of my bed. For the first time in years I find myself falling asleep in one position, and waking up hours later in the same position. I get up in the morning without back pain. I nearly cried that first morning when I got up and could just walk out of my room without being hunched over or limping from my back being so sore. It's been glorious to just simply get up and walk off without any pain. These days I have more issues waking up with 'dead arm' from sleeping on one side for too long... a problem I haven't had in years because my mattress kept me tossing all night. This bed also breathes so much better. My tempur bed usually left me sweaty as it just radiated my body heat back at me so I'd wake up sweltering. In summer I'd change out my sheets, make my bed and for about 5 months, I wouldn't even sleep in the bed because I needed the blankets and comforter under me to keep the bed from getting so hot. This bed doesn't have that issue. while it's still foam, it doesn't trap the heat in. Makes a huge difference in sleep quality when the temperature stays fairly regulated. I find myself looking forward to laying on my bed each night. I sleep better and for longer intervals. I wake up with less pain in my body. I sleep on my sides without the constant ache in my hip from pressure. I'm not as exhausted as I have been in the past because I'm getting better sleep at night now. Seriously, I've recommended this mattress to many people already. it was so easy to buy, sets up without too much difficulty (with two people unpacking it) and it sleeps wonderfully. It's been a month now and I have absolutely no regrets with buying this bed. In fact, I'm hoping that they still make this bed when I need a new one, because I'd buy another one without hesitation.";I love this bed.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;RD2KFTAOSSFPK;;2018-05-31;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;4.0;"I am writing this review on the morning after my first night's sleep on this mattress. I am giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. I will update and/or edit later as appropriate after multiple nights, but I felt it was important to the validity of the review to start out with ""first impressions"". Let me state at the outset that no person nor any company has offered or given any inducement or incentive for this review, nor asked for it in any way. I read and referenced many reviews when searching for a new mattress, and wanted to give others the same help that the reviews gave me. That said, here goes. The set-up: I am 5-3, weigh about 115, and am disabled. I can walk, but I have various physical issues which put me in chronic pain. I have slept on traditional mattresses, the original Temperpedic, (which I have no idea how to spell, obviously!) and futons. Of those, I normally preferred and defaulted to, fairly high quality futons which combine batting layers and inner coils. I have lower back pain and hip pain. For a while, I have been having intense pain during the night that went away when I slept at hostels in NORCAL which have foam mattresses. I realized that the intensification of my normal daily pain was really detracting from the quality of my life so I knew that I had to switch mattresses. I cannot afford an expensive mattress, so I set my budget and started reading reviews. I read a really good one of the Zinus and could find only review-for-hire reviews of the higher priced memory foam mattresses. The really good review of the Zinus, among many which I read that varied, mentioned that the reviewer had tried more expensive memory foam mattresses which he identified by name. Of course, I don't know the guy, but it seemed genuine so I decided to try it. I waited for one of Amazon's periodic sales. I did pay attention to the manufacturer's comments about how to decide which thickness to get. I went for the 8-inch because it allegedly was firmer. So: Unpacking and opening went well, because I got my neighbors to do it. I'm small and disabled. They didn't follow directions but intuitively deployed the precise method which I later discovered was the recommended one. I opened windows to make sure that if there was any chemical smell, it would dissipate since I have asthma. I couldn't detect any, but I did feel a slight burning in my nose so it was probably there at least on the first day. I let the mattress decompress for about 30 hours, over night and until bedtime (we set it up at about 6:00 p.m. on the day it arrived, and I went to bed on it at about 11:00 p.m. on the next night). I was particularly concerned about soreness in my lower back, neck, and legs which had been causing me problems during the night. This would be over and above my normal chronic pain. I experienced none of that last night. I would normally awaken several times in the night with tenderness in my hips or lower back and have to take steps to relieve pain or pressure. I did not experience that last night. I slept through the night. When I awakened, I had no intense pain in my lower back or hips, just the mild normal ache. My neck was stiff and sore but I have a cheap pillow (my next purchase) so I can't blame the mattress for that. So, first night, good news and the exact result that I sought. A few notes. I might have gone for the six-inch if it is even firmer. I couldn't decide between the six inch and the eight inch but I went with the eight inch. I watched a video review of the 12-inch where the guy reviewing it said ""meh"". I forget his name. He gave the 12-inch a 2 to 3 out of 5. He complained about it being too soft, but the description on Amazon very clearly said, if you want a firmer mattress, don't get the 12-inch. So I put that on him. I also noticed that the guy had another mattress standing against the wall in the video. I've read about people who review mattresses in exchange for free mattresses and money. One story talked about a person who outfitted an entire household with mattresses by reviewing them. Some of those reviewers get Brand X's mattress in exchange for dissing Brand Y's product. So, I don't know about this guy. One point he did make: It's a fairly inexpensive mattress. I got mine for about $150 on one of Amazon's lure-you-in sales (their algorithms track your searches and show you sales of what you want, don't be fooled, they do for sure). I can't afford a grand for the high dollar memory foam mattresses or even $600, at least not right now. Maybe down the line, but I would have to sleep on one first. If a Zinus at $150 gives you the same night's sleep as the other guy at $1000, it's a no brainer for me. Another note about that guy's video. He said, If you have trouble standing, don't get a Zinus. He said of the 12-inch, it gave no firmness against which to push to stand. That is the exact opposite of what I experienced this morning. I very much do have trouble sitting up in bed in the morning due to my disability. I had particularly noticed of late that I had to basically use the bedside table and the nearby built-in cabinet to hoist myself to a sitting position. That problem was part of why I knew that I had to make some changes. This morning, I sat right straight up and got out of bed, which I have not been able to do in several years. So I take issue with that and again, it is likely because he didn't read the specs and got the 12-inch instead of one of the firmer variants. I also watched a husband and wife set up a Zinus. They were hysterical. I tried to find a review by them, partly because they were funny and partly because they were both larger folks, and they were sleeping together on the Zinus. I wondered if it worked out for them. So, 4 out of 5 stars for the Zinus 8-inch after set-up, decompression, and first night's sleep. I'll update if necessary, that is, if it worsens or substantially improves. I'd give it 3-1/2 stars as a precaution if I could (can you give 1/2 stars here?) just because one-night does not a long-term barometer reading make. If future nights prompt a downgrade, I'll add a post-script.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c69;R2Q19IDB7YSNVK;;2023-04-01;TRUE;B01MR51N1S;4.0;As I was moving to a new place, I decided to order this mattress a little early to ensure that it had ample time to expand properly. The packing and delivery process was on time, they delivered it to the mailroom in m absence which great and I received free prime delivery! The box was accurate as described during the checkout process. However, the box was a bit heavy and large, making it difficult for one person to carry it using their hands. I had to use a hand trolley to move it to the first floor, which was not a big issue. When it came to decompression, I was initially nervous about whether the mattress would fully expand. I had read some reviews that suggested the customer support was not great and returning the product was practically impossible if it does not expand. However, after opening the mattress and laying it out for decompression, I found it to be very comfortable. The mattress comes with a tool to cut the plastic, which I found to be a bit blunt, but once I had opened the outer cover, I was able to unroll the mattress onto the floor. It did not immediately bounce back to its claimed height, but within an hour, it had regained about half of its height. After 24 hours, the mattress had fully expanded, except for one corner that did not fully come back. While I was a bit disappointed by this, I decided to give it a try before getting too upset. After using the mattress for about two weeks, I found it to be very comfortable, even though it was different from the mattress I had been using before. It is firm to the touch, but I find it very comfortable when I sleep, as it immediately adjusts to my body shape and curves. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, and the mattress has exceeded my expectations. I was able to get it at a discount of around $340 (including tax), and I think it is a great product for the price range. While the corner that did not fully expand affected the aesthetics of the mattress, it does not affect the quality of my sleep and justifies overall four star for this product.;Perfect but the corner!;real;real;B01MR51N1S;67;Home & Kitchen;Zinus 6 Inch Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress / CertiPUR-US Certified / Bed-in-a-Box / Pressure Relieving, Twin, White;146094;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:33:39.414

Regardless, I think recognition of those events is so important and goes a long way to improve your relationship with someone. I came across these while I was trying to find some alternative and I will never buy real flowers again! Except, maybe in the case of death of a loved one (a human, loved one.) It's would probably be passe to send paper flowers to someone if their spouse or child passes. These are sturdy, big enough to make an impression but not as big as the pictures make it appear. Additionally, I like that they never die. It always struck me as odd that we give someone who is grieving an item that dies.

This dent is not as bad as the first but sheesh. Why are they sending this in a bag?? We know how delivery people throw packages around. Original review: This bottle was shipped in a bag so I received it with 2 significant dents. This needs to be shipped in a small box! There is nothing wrong with the product itself IF it hadn‚Äôt incurred damage during shipping. I love the color, the handle, and everything else about it, and it doesn‚Äôt leak with straw closed‚Äî so I immediately ordered a replacement bottle and I will change my rating to 5 stars if I receive it without dents. I understand that sometimes Amazon screws over the seller and puts their products in improper packaging! So IF THIS IS THE CASE, Amazon needs to stop putting this in BAGS and the seller needs to be made aware so they can hound Amazon to change that (this is why I‚Äôll change my rating later, because I actually think this is Amazon‚Äôs fault, but I want to rate it low right now so the seller can see this!!)

I couldn‚Äôt stand the traditional tumbler with magnetic lids, flip life, or straws. They all leak! No matter how much they claim they don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs in your bag, and the bag tips over, you‚Äôre losing 30-40oz of water onto the floor. The best solution for no leaking, without having a screw top, is a flip up straw. However, almost every bottle on the market with a flip straw is a cylindrical shape, so they do not fit in cup holders with a size above 20-24oz. That‚Äôs just not enough space for ice and water for Texas heat! This bottle does an amazing job of using a tumbler style shape with a water bottle style lid. It fits in my bag perfect, it fits in my cup holder perfect, it‚Äôs super easy to fill, drink, and clean. And boy is it STURDY!

However, the valve that is used to keep it leakproof for the air vent and straw hole are not one unit. There is also no way of taking this part out to make sure it is cleaned and then thoroughly dried. This is a huge concern because if moisture gets under that valve then mold could accumulate with no way of really knowing or being able to clean it. I feel this is a huge design flaw and I‚Äôm really surprised I haven‚Äôt seen any other info on this. Since there isn‚Äôt any other info or complaints, maybe there really is no issue here.

Because the way it works is, it attracts the fruit flies into the top, where they are pulled down by a fan, and then, they get stuck to basically a type of gluetrap (although not terribly more adhesive than scotch tape if you ask me). So I put this up for a while and checked it every couple of days. There were hardly ever any bugs on the glue plate! Maybe I'd see two after a couple of days. Maybe after two weeks you'd see five. I wasn't changing it; I didn't have to, they were barely used. But my wife noticed something interesting. *Fruit flies had mostly disappeared.* And I realized she was right. We still had some occasionally, but not nearly as many as we'd had before we got the thing. I don't know where they went; they definitely were not, by and large, getting caught by the trap. But they also weren't buzzing about the kitchen on the regular. We would sometimes use an electric ""tennis"" swatter to try and get some of them. Some days we could get four or five in a good swinging session. But after this trap went in, we barely reached for the swatter anymore. So. I have no idea how, but it seems in our case, having this trap reduced our fruit fly problem significantly. I just wish I could explain *how.*";It looks like it doesn't work... but it does!;real;real;B07B6RZP4H;71;Home & Kitchen;Katchy Indoor Insect Trap - Catcher & Killer for Mosquitos, Gnats, Moths, Fruit Flies - Non-Zapper Traps for Inside Your Home - Catch Insects Indoors with Suction, Bug Light & Sticky Glue (Black);100541;4.0;10;2023-04-29 08:34:10.663

SIMPLE * You get 4 round STICKY PADS and I had lot of fruit flies and so don't think my first pad will last long. * So getting REPLACEMENT PADS (if you have a lot of critters to kill) is a POTENTIAL ISSUE. * I plan to cut the pads out of the rectangular sticky pads I already have, so not concerned about buying their pre-cut, round, small, sticky pads (Some reviews say that are not always readily available???) * I would pay more to get this same on with a STRONG FAN (i.e. to create more downward suction) * This has 2 settings of fan speed and the higher speed is NOT as powerful as I would have liked. * On high fan setting, it does get MOST of the tiny flies that get over the top. HOWEVER, I saw numerous of them land on the top and ""hang out"" or crawl around on the top lid and NOT get sucked in. MOST get sucked in; I don't know why some seemed immune to the suction as they sat on top of the grate type of opening; more suction power would have pulled them down. * The other potential issue is: NOT all that get sucked in land and stick on the sticky pad; you can see them crawling around inside the container but NOT stuck on the pad. Only had it for 2 days and not sure yet if those end up on the stick pad, eventually? Will have to observe longer on this. * Finally, mine started working almost immediately in DARK KITCHEN where I have more than a few, much more, of the little bas-tids flying near the trap. Seller says allow 3 days; mine was almost immediately sucking them in. *.CONCLUSION: If I learn more or different I may update this.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c6d;R20FZSQ79P5L8X;;2020-11-11;TRUE;B07B6RZP4H;5.0;I purchased a scratchNdent and found my item had been used and slightly damaged, the top swirl grill was missing a small piece, and one of the sticky disks had been put into the unit already with a gnat stuck to it. Okay. I plugged it in, pushed one of the setting buttons (standard) and the light came on and the little fan makes a little bit of breeze, but wet a finger and hold it at the bottom and it is breezing out. It is also bigger than I expected, but I have such a tiny bug issue in this place, I don't care as long as it works. Something was mentioned about it works better in lower light levels. So. I plugged it in and set it up in a place I have been having issues. Four hours later, I pick it up to look down in. There's a lot more than one gnat on the mat already. It's doing the job. Great. The local little winged wildlife has resisted: letting the pots dry out good between waterings, watering with a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water, top mulching the pots, and the yellow sticky trap things. This seems to be vacuuming them up. YAY! If this works out I will get a couple more as I have plants in a few areas in my house. Trust me, I have at least six different microbugs including fruit flies, fungus gnats (arrgh!), a different gnat, and not sure exactly but a few are like tiny tiny various sorts of beetles... keeping the swarms down would be wonderful, without killing my plants. I will update this as it goes.. The picture isn't quite truelight because it is fairly dark in there, but. That's what it sorta looks like ON in the dark. To the right that is a matte BLACK surface that it's reflecting off of. Edit: my house is large, my buggie collection is way down on one end of the house where I have my first one, but. I just got a second one, also scratchNdent, to deal with the other end. I seen where someone complained that it is a fly-spa. This will NOT work on houseflies. They are too big and strong to be whooshed down onto the sticky pad. There are other ones built ($60-80) as wall sconces that WILL do the houseflies. This isn't built for that. However all the assorted little gnats and such are collecting at alarming rates on my sticky pads. It is nice to sit at my computer in the evening and not kill at least a dozen tiny assorted buggies. And my fungus gnat problem that came in with some potting soil mix, is pretty much gone. I can't say enough, if you have a grow booth and issues with little critters, that putting one of these in the booth at about two weeks for a night will not affect your grow and if there is anything in there it will clear out most of the problems. I have one room where the booth and most of my houseplants live (plus my spring starts as I go into that season as I update this) and the first one is outside the grow booth on the floor where it clears that room pretty well. Second one installed near the kitchen sink and other bathroom on other end of house, as there is a persistent problem there. I don't think it will catch sewer flies but those tend to respond to hot vinegar flushed through a running disposal with hot sink water, then follow with a cut up lemon and some icecubes run through the disposer. I will let you know if I get those little buggers back and if it can catch one or not. On both I am turning them off during the day and on after dark, as that is when the UV light seems to be the most visible to the little winged pests. I also want to see if the kitchen one will draw spiders. There are a few kinds that are drawn to dead prey, and though I have sticky traps for them, if this will be able to stick one down or not if it comes to check it out. Another thing I will update. Edit update. Plant area one is catching mostly gnats, vatloads of them. Kitchen has only a few, but is getting the fruit flies from the bananas. I put spider traps near both and the kitchen catch is up. Could not be happier with both Katchys. Have spring bedding and flower starts going and a new grow in the tent. I‚Äôve put one in the tent a few times and no gnattie problem (last time will be day/ night 18 so as not to mess up auto blooming). No chemicals. Still worth the price. Replacing the sticky pads is super easy too. Edit: very late fall. We are the house servants of two mixed breed part Persian purries. The grey and white one in particular has very fine hair and a very full coat despite daily brushing/grooming. So we have slightly pre-used fur all over. Plus lots of house dust-joys of where we live. I have to take a q-tip to the top of both my Katchy‚Äôs weekly to keep the house glorp from obstructing airflow (also have to do it to our tower fans). Still catching the tiniest no-see-ums, fungus gnats and fruit flies. With fall garden harvest, the fruit flies moved in. I added a capful of apple cider taped off with a few holes next to the kitchen one, and it was literally carpeted with fruit flies in the bottom. The plants that came in brought micro buggies, and those numbers are quickly dropping as well. A Katchy doesn‚Äôt instantly get your population but in days you should have a disgusting collection on the bottom pad‚Ä¶ I purchased a no- zap UV/sticky pad catcher meant for houseflies and installed over the toilet at the ceiling. It also does the job with a little time. So. Katchy do their job well, are easy to use and maintain, and paired with a true flycatcher, really helps keep you unbothered. $40 well spent.;Works-note, houseflies will laugh at it but.

DAY 1 - The item arrived and it was super easy to setup. All you had to do was press a button open up the bottom compartment, place a glue-paper pad inside it (after you peel off the protective sheet off of the sticky side). Then you connect up the power cord, plug it in, and then choose a power setting from the two buttons on top (Low Setting and Standard Setting). I set it up at Standard Setting during the day, and then set it at Low Setting at overnight. I also set the unit up right beside an open bowl of Apple Cider Vinegar, to help attract the fruit fly pests to the unit. I checked it the next day, with the unit still running, and saw fruit flies flying and walking over the fan grills and not being sucked in at all. Meanwhile, the Apple Cider Vinegar bowl did it's job at attracting the fruit flies, and even killed a few that landed inside the bowl. DAY 1 VERDICT - ONE STAR, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MDO A ZERO STAR RATING. IT STRAIGHT UP DID NOTHING. Day 2 - After turning it on the Standard setting, within a few hours, there were a few fruit flies stuck on the pad. After leaving it overnight, there weren't hardly any more fruit flies on the pad. Meanwhile, my apple cider vinegar and fly paper traps had a significantly higher of captured insects. In fact, these lure-trap combinations did better than the ""Katchy"", even though I paired it with an apple cider vinegar lure. DAY 2 VERDICT: It is now sucking in fruit flies, though not apparently attracting very many of them. Day 3 - The Katchy trap, on standard mode, works best in the dark. During the day, with ANY ambient lights on, insects just aren't attracted to it. Placing it next to another lure works - like a dish of apple cider vinegar. There are all kinds of DIY, Apple Cider Vinegar and soap solution traps you can pair with the Katchy, as well as fly paper strips and sheets. But the Katchy is not a one-and-done, singular solution to your fruit fly problem. Fruit flies reproduce FAST, and they lay about 400 eggs at once. They also live for 25-30 days, so you must focus on eliminate their food source, and then use traps to control their population. DAY 3 VERDICT - It starts slowly, and the results will not knock your socks off, if you were looking to this device to eradicate your pest problem. I can be used as PART of your more comprehensive pest plan, but it's not the silver bullet that they advertise themselves to be. THREE STARS. It's okay, but there are more effective solutions.";DAY 3 (of 3) VERDICT: USE IT TO HELP CONTROL PESTS, BUT WILL NOT ELIMINATE THEM.;real;real;B07B6RZP4H;71;Home & Kitchen;Katchy Indoor Insect Trap - Catcher & Killer for Mosquitos, Gnats, Moths, Fruit Flies - Non-Zapper Traps for Inside Your Home - Catch Insects Indoors with Suction, Bug Light & Sticky Glue (Black);100541;4.0;10;2023-04-29 08:34:10.663

Little mosquitos that have gotten into the house during the day pester us all night and ruin our sleep. Lately we've had, what I thought, was a single mosquito in our bedroom that was dive bombing us - I could hear it as it buzzed around my head. We had to do something. I saw this product, read the reviews and decided to try it. The first day we got it we left it running in our bedroom overnight. I didn't hear any mosquitos all night, but thought it might just be a coincidence. This morning I checked the sticky pad and was very surprised to find that, in the course of only about 8 hours, it trapped a small moth and four mosquitos! The Katchy will be a permanent fixture in our bedroom. It was definitely worth the price. A few practical notes: It is very easy to set up - just remove the cover from a pad, place it in the device and close the latch. The fan is very quiet, though in a very quiet room you may still hear it. The sound is not unpleasant, more like white noise. In a dark room the UV light may seem bright and it pulsates in brightness slowly. So you might want to place it where it isn't visible while you're sleeping.

I'm using it to protect a queen-sized 3"" memory foam topper for my bed against my beloved nemesis: a 5 kg cat. When my feline companion suffered from an unwelcome malady, she found comfort on my month-old memory foam mattress topper, 3-week-old down duvet (dry-clean only, of course) and brand spanking new blanket. She decided to prance over and urinate several gallons atop me and my partner. Twice in a week. The so-called ""waterproof mattress cover"" I owned at the time of the first incident, and the other brand I purchased from a large store with a red circle after the second, did not live up to one small cat's piddle. They soaked through, ruined the comforter and memory foam topper, and left us thoroughly pissed. This cover fits great over the memory foam topper, though the corners are a bit snug to the topper. They tend to pull it up, and I assume that's because most mattresses have rounded corners or the depth of the mattress pulls the sheet down. I'm working with 3"" thickness, which leaves plenty of material snug beneath the topper for a solid fit. The terrycloth-like surface of the waterproof part fully covers the topper. Better yet, it feels soft and gives off very little sound whenever we sit or lie on it. I'm leery of anything that produces a lot of noise at night and this certainly doesn't.

I put it on my bed and that night I had the worst night sleep~ I felt like it was so foreign to my body and I literally started crying and wondering if I should just take it off and send it back. But, I'm so grateful I didn't. I read the next day that it takes a few weeks to get accustomed to ~ just like a new pair of shoes, it has to be broken in. So, I continued to sleep on it and it's the best thing ever! After about 3 days I was already starting to notice positive changes. Now, I'm so grateful I didn't give up.

There was absolutely no odor or fumes when we opened this, in the house, in winter, windows closed. Zero. I have asthma; I would have detected fumes when others do not. And I did so in the dining area of our small house with an L-shaped living room dining room, so it was pretty much 'in my face' for hours. 2/3 expanded in 3 hours. The rest of it was finished when we got up the next morning. Far less than even 12 hours. It did not tear. It is bulky, (3 inch queen size) so I had help to move it to the bed, but its not really heavy that way. We did not drag it or pull on just one corner; we folded it in half and carried it to the bed. Then gave it a tug or two to align it. No indication it would tear. Either I have a different product than the other reviewers, or some reviews are by competitors? Because all that was wonderful. Comfort: Fantastic! I have recently hit the point of osteoarthritis in my hip, and am a side sleeper...and it felt like I was sleeping with a rock under me. Not sleeping well at all, needless to say. The 3 inch foam eliminated that issue for me as much as could be possible....95% of pain and discomfort gone, vanished! Heat retention: I placed an old mattress cover around it, the kind that used to have some quilting but has been washed to the point it should have been trashed really...so just a touch of some insulation more than a sheet. The sheet I put on top was much heavier/thicker cotton sort of surface than any other sheets I have. The foam did retain some heat, but that was perfect for the arthritis in my hip, knees, feet. I will likely be putting away one of my two heavy blankets I have been using with a light quilted bedspread that is a good air block, and that's great. That former arrangement was too heavy and would get too hot and awaken me at night, but I needed that to get my joints warm and 'quiet' enough to sleep. Not anymore! The mattress topper gets very comfortably warm in just a few minutes. i am writing this in April in south central PA; temps have been in the upper 30s to upper 40s at night and our thermostat is set at 72 at night, though I have to close the vent in my small bedroom or i get roasted when the heat flows. The thermostat is that high because of the illness of my roommate and our 70 year old brick home is a bit drafty, needing windows and new insulation. I was quite comfortable having some gentle heat from retention by the foam on my joints, while my face and shoulders enjoyed the cooler room temp. Its wonderfully soft and cushiony. I was comfortable both in my normal side sleeping positions, and also when I had my head rather elevated on multiple pillows (which puts more pressure on the hips). I did not experience any difficulty at all rolling over, even though I am 5'10"" and 195 lbs. I frequently roll over... so much so I use a queen bed all to myself. In fact, it was EASIER for me to roll over than it had been rolling over the hard mattress surface...my mattress is not a rock hard one, maybe the high end of medium firm. It has had about 6 years of regular use and has just recently developed just a touch of sag in the middle...just enough to increase pressure on my hip bone in certain positions....but this extra pressure disappeared with this wonderful topper. I would anticipate that because this is foam, that at some point it will begin to stay compressed and eventually require replacing. That is affordable at this price.... I see the same complaints made by products costing even four times what I paid for this ($90 plus sales tax). if/when I experience this, i will come back and update my review for a time concept. If I don't experience this within 6 months, I might buy a second one for a backup. The pricing was great, and necessary, because I also need to replace my chair in the living room,which aggravates my arthritis, and I couldn't afford both a good new recliner and another mattress...which might not have been good enough without a topper anyway.

I always find myself making excuses for the cheapest options on Amazon, before they even get here, too. You know the generic, everyday department store kind of items that don't need to be brand name. Whether it's something like a mattress topper, tools, electronics, etc. I always assume that the item is gonna have something thats a little off before it arrives. Thats possibly because I'll look for things like button-down shirts, or fitted sheets, and end up finding a perfectly fitting shirt, dare I say the best shirt I've ever lain across my back. The shirt that will change my life. However, in the recent years I must remind myself to adopt a policy of pre-dissapointment. Because usually, right after the nice little shirtprise occurs, I find that the fine garment I purchased, used, for 3 american dollars, has a third sleeve. Just for instance. I am not going to sit here and lie about it any longer.. dammit I loved that shirt, and when I think how shallow it was of me to reject a fine shirt like that, over something as trivial as an extra sleeve sewn into the back of the shoulder.. well I'll just say I'm not proud of it.. but my tale of epic shirtprise that ultimately ended in shirtzaster causes me to digress.. My original point was that if you're going to search through the bottom of the Amazon barrel, your gonna get a third sleeve every once in awhile. Well let me tell you, this 2"" topper was the cheapest option I found in the size I needed, and this intercourse rebound dampener is no three-sleever. The quality of my sleep before getting this topper was comparable to falling asleep in a bar stool. in a bar. I would wake up every 10 minutes, every morning i would need two advil and a midol just to get out of my medeviel torture rack of a bed. My neck, my back, my elbow and my sack would cause me quite a bit of bad pain. Not these days though. These days I fall asleep before my head even hits the pillow. I mean so fast I don't even have time to say goodnight to my wife or maintain a meaningful relationship with her and my 2.5 beautiful miracle children, and that's one of the few statements I've made here that you can take to the bank. To summarize, all I have to say... is that I'm not all that complicated, or all that rich. I'm not all that passionate about my marriage, and I'm definitely not gonna be gettin any of those mug's claiming I'm the world's greatest father, or world's greatest anything, and frankly just bringing up those facts used to cause me some mild, severe depression and life was just so bleak. But today I walk the streets with my head held high and just a little cocky, as If to say, ""hey girl, what your name is?"" To the world, and act unaffected when answered by the world with a firm ""get away from me."" Basically friends, fellow amazoner's, is that today I'm a changed man, and as far as the government and the paper boy are concerned the old me doesn't exist. It has done so much as transformed my meaningless existence into just a literal existence! Its turned my metaphorical toothless frown into a lipped horizontal line. Its as if myself and this single little 2"" memory foam mattress topper were lost in this big crazy world, doing big crazy things, with big crazy people, in big crazy places, wearing big crazy hats, but then the rain stopped, the clouds parted, the sun shone through and we started a wicked-awesome moshpit in the mud with each other, but we're also doin it at the first woodstock or like one of the first 4 lalapaloozas, and the 2"" memory foam mattress topper and I are just out there in the middle of the crowd.. gettin all graphic in nature. Just the two of us, just each other, and I think we were with an old ""my pillow"" i found in a stadium bathroom awhile back that has the word ""jabroni"" written on it with sharpie.. but hey man, that pillow was a serious horndoggin-party-brother and we are all gods children... in closing, the mattress topper was more okay than anticipated. my previous experience with ""brand-less"" items will now be quietly repressed until the next three-sleever item is delivered. 5 out of 5 would buy again.";Better than you would think;real;real;B07MY34QH7;74;Home & Kitchen;Linenspa 3 Inch Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Gel Infused Queen Mattress Topper, CertiPUR-US Certified;104680;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:34:33.960

The brightness is adjustable, and there are a variety of colors to choose from which is great depending on the mood. I've had them close to a month now I believe and they have been working great, save for one glaring issue; Straight out of the box, a small strip of the LEDS do not show red very well. On the red color setting, it is dull, and on any other color setting that utilizes the red light the LEDs are a different color than the other strips. To be fair, it is only about 4 of the LEDs (in one continuous line), and luckily it is in a spot that most people don't see, but it is still annoying as it disrupts the flow.

This product taught me that is not always the case. A lesson learned the hard way is that if the description does not specifically state a feature or detail you are looking for, it most likely is not present. As the product description called them drawer organizers. I mentally compared them with the larger size in my kitchen drawers. I therefore expected they would have side to side interlocking edges like my kitchen trays. As I intended to use them on my tabletop works area, Interlocking side to side is a requirement where they will slide all over the tabletop. Overall, I consider them a good product for the purpose described. But they are limited to an areaSuch as a drawer to provide retaining walls such as a drawer to provide retaining walls. The clear plastic is also a hard plastic and is more likely to crack or break than flex a bit When squeezed or pressed upon. Another problem is there are no directions. It is self explanatory however all the number of Trey's and the little rubber dots on a sheet that are in the package but they merely stick on as non skid feet.

The plastic construction has some reinforcement to increase strength at the corners and this feature reduces bending. I use them for hanging a variety of men's shirt, ranging from lighter weight to a heavier flannel, and have not noticed any substantial bending. The relatively narrow construction means also that many shirts can be hung together, thereby maximizing use of closet space. The major problem with any plastic hanger is the weakness of its neck. So far, no problems with cracking or breakage. Although, with any light weight plastic hanger, I always use some caution to avoid forcing the hanger onto a rod. Excessive force would place enough stress on the hanger to shear off the top. Also, if you need to hang jackets or coats, a stronger hanger other than these will be necessary. COLOR The color assortment is notable and attractive. Selecting several colors will introduce some variety into closet decor and will allow you to separate shirts by personal choice, seasonal use, or just to have a variety of fun color options other than basic black and white. Choosing hangers by school or sports team colors is also a welcome option. BUNDLE SIZE Notable is the fact that these hangers are offered in different bundle sizes. The 20-pack may be the most often purchased, but larger packs are more economically priced.

They have at least two issues: 1) Break easily 2) Too slippery for women's clothing Though we ""modded"" our plastic hangers by putting hot glue strips on them to make them less slippery, there was no way to get around them constantly breaking if you weren't careful enough when you pulled something off the plastic hanger. At some point I got fed up and did some searching and found these hangers. I bought some. This is my second order, so that tells you I'm good with this product. Though the body of the hanger is still plastic (albeit covered with cloth), the metal hook is very sturdy compared to the plastic hangers. When the plastic hangers would break, it was usually the hook that would break off. After probably over a year of use on the original order, I do not recall having any of these hangers break. The other great positive is that all the slippery fabric items that slip off plastic hangers stay put on this hanger. When a number of our plastic hangers broke, I made this second order for enough hangers to replace all the plastic ones if we happened to want to do so. This leads to the one potential detractor for some customers. I personally felt we could get rid of the plastic hangers and be done with them, but I was told not to discard them. The velvety covering does make it harder to just slip something off the hanger. While I tend to not care about this, some family members do not really want to use these velvety hangers for clothing that doesn't need the velvet to stay on the hanger. I think this is mostly an issue when the clothes hang on a fairly high rod where a shorter person might not be as able to lift the clothing off the hanger.

And the 11piece system went up around $10dollars or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29dollars. And as the 17piece was no longer available I decided to buy the 11piece system (even though it didn‚Äôt come with the flat blade as the larger system comes with two different blades) and apply the coupon that came with it at the time, and apply the savings to buying the flat blade separately on their website, but luckily they had it on Amazon also, so I ordered both items from Amazon. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. As someone who has used the Original Magic bullet, there is a difference in the systems that are available now, as opposed to the systems from 2005 but before 2015, which were all much better in terms of quality and better priced overall, in addition to the fact that you could still get the cheap 2 for 1 deals and have two 17piece systems and two juicing attachment systems for under $50dollars total. I think my first system lasted around ten years, so it was pretty good, and then the system I bought later in 2006 was just as good but better designed ‚Äì that one still works, but my mom kidnapped it. So I really needed a new one as I was tired of using a giant blender to make a single serving smoothie, and very small 1-2 servings of other things, etc.. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn‚Äôt look as good as in previous editions of 2005-2015, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc-in the blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the magic bullet then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy)‚Ä¶ Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. To clean- blend soapy warm water then wipe by hand. Below you will find the links to (cut and paste to) where I found the Magic Bullet with the coupon offer and the page for the additional flat-blade accessory.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c7a;R2JRULQS8JETS0;;2023-01-04;TRUE;B012T634SM;4.0;"This is ridiculously easy to use. Screw the blade on and go. If you need to move something down towards the blade, it's already completely closed so you can shake it and pop it straight back on there. When you're done, you rinse the blade (also ridiculously easy) and you're good to go again. I will admit that I fall below average on blender usage, so ease of use and minimal risk of creating a mess were key in the decision process. There hasn't been a day that we haven't used this at least twice because it takes like 2 minutes start to finish, including clean up. Which makes it very convenient that this takes up almost zero counter space, because it lives there now. That was part of the reason we didn't have a blender before; the cupboards were already full and we had little counter space. Moved into a place with a lot more kitchen space and got this almost as a tester. We've been using it for a week and I'm already ordering the Nutribullet for its full sized blender and larger containers. I'm still going to be using this one for protein drinks, though. It's way too convenient to just press down for like 10-20 seconds when I'm only barely awake. It's also convenient that it's quiet enough to let my boyfriend stay asleep. I wish I could describe in words how violently opposed to ANY noise this man is in the morning. It takes me 10 seconds to close the bedroom door quietly enough, but he doesn't hear this from the kitchen. We have a cat hammock on the wall under the cupboards and I've used it right next to a cat who never got used to the spray noise from an aerosol dispenser air freshener and he just lifted his head and looked at me. It's still a blender, it makes noise, but it makes more noise to use the ice dispenser in the refrigerator door; fairly comparable to the whirring/whining noise the dispenser makes before it actually dispenses the ice. I would say that the primary reason I jumped on buying the Nutribullet after this is the lack of features. It has one blending option, one speed, one blade mechanism. There are no larger container sizes available, which isn't a big deal, but it was something that I was looking into within the first week. The one other issue I have with the system is the style of the containers. There are, for lack of a better word, ridges at the bottom of the cups that seem to hold on to some of the ingredients you might add, which means you'll have to shake it up sometimes. If you add powder first, it will get stuck next to them and it is weirdly difficult to shake or even spoon off of them. It's still WAY easier to just shake the container than spoon ingredients down/in with a regular blender. Overall I was so thrilled with this purchase that I immediately bought a significantly more expensive option from the same company to keep the function but gain some features. I would actually probably give this 4.5 stars if they would let me, the only things that kept it from a full 5 were the accessories/add-ons.";We've been using this multiple times a day;real;real;B012T634SM;84;Home & Kitchen;Magic Bullet Blender, Small, Silver, 11 Piece Set;91158;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:35:51.931

However, the problem with that was that it had a million pieces to clean (or fail to clean), and it separated (centrifugally) the pulp, etc, thereby wasting a whole lot of nutritional and caloric plant matter. With the MB, you get the whole, wholesome fruit/veggie smoothie experience! Although the Magic Bullet is only 250 watts, it is much more effective at pur√©eing the fruit/veggie matter. The whole thing feels sturdy and quality. I get the sense that the MB's design has been perfected over the years. It's sleek, sturdy, and efficient. The cord isn't even too long, which I love.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c7a;ROKMPGHTBPV41;;2021-08-03;TRUE;B012T634SM;4.0;"I've pretty much switched to having protein shakes in the morning along with the occasional shake as a meal replacement or whenever I get hungry and need to satisfy that hunger with something healthier than what I used to eat...at first I tried blender bottles. They were mostly, meh. I've determined a LOT of how efficient your bottle may be depends a great deal on the protein powder you plan to use. They are NOT created equal and some blend better than others. I try to shy away from plant-based meal replacement/protein shake powder for only one reason: I've tried more than 7 different kinds and I've never liked the taste of any of them. Some were better than others, but none made me want to finish the whole bottle and I ended up donating each to friends who were okay with the flavor or genuinely liked the taste. Not sure if this is true with all plant based shakes, but so far (for me anyway) it has been. I prefer whey based shakes...but not even all of them are equal. This is a case where the phrase, ""You get what you pay for"" pretty much applies. Not 100% mind you, but far more often than not. I tried a chocolate peanut butter protein powder from Complete Nutrition once (I had a $50 gift card) and the bottle of powder cost the whole $50...which for my meager budget was quite expensive...but man did it blend and taste incredible. Best I've ever tried, in fact. No sugar...but you'd never know it from the taste. Unfortunately that first bottle was also my last because my finances simply cannot afford it. I discovered around this time that even the harder to blend whey protein shakes would blend much better with an actual blender rather than a shaker bottle. I've stuck with them ever since. For quick protein shakes that do not require ice (more than a single cube) and no frozen ingredients, the Magic Bullet works great. If your goal is to get a powerful blender to mix frozen fruits and veggies to make a smoothie, you would be better suited to look elsewhere. The motor in the Magic Bullet simply isn't strong enough to work on anything more than as I mentioned before, a single ice cube. I tried 2 cubes once, and it was apparent from the moment I turned it on that this was not going to work. I pretty much knew this going in having done my research ahead of time on the blender and I knew the limitations, so this didn't surprise me. If you truly wish to make a smoothie using frozen anything, I don't know that a personal blender exists that can conclusively show they are effective at blending well. The motors simply aren't powerful enough to expect any kind of efficiency...not without running the risk of burning out the motor and/or getting significant chunks of ice or fruit left over regardless of how long you try to blend it. You may as well invest in a larger model that has the power to blend whatever you wish. There may be a personal model I don't know of which can do this, but I'd imagine if it can, it will come with a rather significant price tag as well. Just keep that in mind. For me, I love my Magic Bullet. I know what it can and cannot do, and that's okay. ESPECIALLY for the price. It comes with the most cups and attachments I've ever seen, again, especially for how little it cost. I would gladly trade 2 of the cups for one larger cup however. Maybe twice the size? Again, this is a very minor complaint considering what it comes with, but it's nice to know I can order a cup which is bigger that fits the Magic Bullet specifically...which I'm sure I'll do at some point. For making my protein shakes with almond milk, an ice cube and maybe a small chunk of banana and a spoonful of peanut butter, it works pretty much flawlessly.";Pretty Good Blender - Especially For The Price;real;real;B012T634SM;84;Home & Kitchen;Magic Bullet Blender, Small, Silver, 11 Piece Set;91158;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:35:51.931

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THESE CUPS but i know what went wrong so i'm sharing my piece so you can learn from me. my 4th is a biter, and very quickly bit holes in the straw piece, leading to me cutting off the mangled bit of straw on the top since it was eventually going to snap off and become a choking hazard. after that i noticed that backwash was an issue, if i gave him a cup of water with lunch, it would very quickly become disgusting and cloudy because of the food in his mouth. i bought another one of these cups, and for some reason he didn't bite the straw on this one. backwash has never been an issue with that cup. i now know that they sell replacement straws on their website, so if this is an issue you're having then please just replace the piece. these cups can be very finicky if you don't have the straws seal pushed all the way in place, so be sure when you're cleaning it that you're putting it back in firmly, making sure the weight is all the way in as well. the little cleaning tool they give you is more than sufficient for cleaning the straw, and unless the cup was left with juice in it for days and days without cleaning then soap and water should be more than enough to maintain a stain and odor free cup. my little one has recently gotten into hiding things, mostly behind the couch, but for the life of me i cannot find where he put his cup, so i'm here, buying a 2 pack of these babies because i know that nothing else works quite as well. i've tried other brands versions of this weighted straw bottle but none really compare.;as a mother of 4, these are my favorite cups i swear by;real;real;B07L4DHNVK;85;Home & Kitchen;Munchkin¬Æ Any Angle‚Ñ¢ Weighted Straw Trainer Cup with Click Lock‚Ñ¢ Lid, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack, Blue/Green;51708;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:35:59.929

It is a bit of a pain to clean but the included brush is very helpful and eventually you get used to the process. The reason I docked a star is because after months of use it began to leak - not even sure from where specifically, but the cap in general leaks during use and it was making a big mess. We began to phase it out because of this, and because our kiddo is gaining the skills to use different kinds of cups at this point.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c7b;RWV7I9UZYW9QL;;2023-01-30;TRUE;B07L4DHNVK;5.0;A lot of reviews I‚Äôve read seem to be user error. My 12 month old drinks from this cup very easily in almost any position and loves it. And after figuring out a few things, I think it is nearly perfect. Let‚Äôs clear up a few things other reviews have complained about, so you will love your new cup too. 1. It leaks/bubbles out cold liquid when taken out of the fridge. -This is not a design flaw but just a physics reaction. Yes, if you take the cup from the fridge to room temp, the cold air inside the cup expands as it warms pushing out a bit of liquid from the straw. Very simple solution is to simply unscrew the top for a minute (maybe less!) so that as the air expands in room temp, and liquid isn‚Äôt pushed up and out of the straw. Seriously, try it. Very simple solution once you realize why it is happening. 2. The valve in the straw make is very difficult to drink out of. -I thought this at first as well. Please do not cut the valve out as other reviews have suggested. The valve is meant to be compressed from front to back (top to bottom) as toddler is drinking, and once compressed slightly, offers nearly no resistance to drinking. When not compressed, keeps your cup leak proof. 3. Difficult to clean. -You can also compress this valve front to back, to insert cleaning brush provided and to allow water to rinse through it easily while cleaning. Knowing how to use the valve makes cleaning very simple. 4. Not leak proof when turned upside down. -I think this has to do with improper straw and stopper placement. You must pull the straw through until it clicks into place and make sure the stopper connected to the straw is firmly placed over the air hole at the top of the lid. Then, no matter how my toddler carries it around, it never leaks when upside down. Also, make sure the lid is screwed on until the handles click over the bumps on the side to lock it on. It is easy to not screw the top on enough if you don‚Äôt know it needs to click in place to lock. I‚Äôm sure a few cup will be made with defects and this won‚Äôt fix everyone‚Äôs problems, but I think a bit more knowledge of how to use the cup properly would solve most of the complaints listed about the cup. User error seems to be the biggest problem with these cups. The only minor draw back I‚Äôve noticed is occasionally getting flicked with liquid when my son finishes drinking and flicks the straw out of his mouth at me. But I think that will get better with time. *Please don‚Äôt let the negative reviews keep you from buying and loving this cup.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c7b;R2FM6FPXTZ15CX;;2019-06-14;TRUE;B07L4DHNVK;4.0;"I bought two of these weighted sippy cups- one for my 3y/o son and one for my 1y/o daughter. My son had been using this Thomas The Train hard-spout sippy cup like, forever and a day. He was hooked on this one specific cup, like I had nightmares about him loosing it! And then the day came that his speech therapist said he needed to switch to a straw-cup (to help strengthen his mouth/face muscles). I bought a variety of straw-type sippy cups and hurled each one at him, hoping one would stick (FIGURATIVELY. Gosh... I would never want to throw anything at my sweet little darling) Eventually, he settled on one... no, not this one here. Another one. But, that one leaked everywhere. And then- the biggest problem- he would throw a darn tantrum every darn day because he couldn't get that last little bit of milk (actually the last 1/3 of the cup of milk) up through the straw while laying down because... gravity. So, I discovered these weighted-straw miracles while shopping in a Rite Aid for over-priced baby nail clippers. Oh, was I delighted! Until I saw the price- $8.99 +sales tax = no-way-jose! So, being the thrify-nifty Mama that I am, I quicky looked these puppies up here on Amazon, and they were only about $5 each... plus, being a shpeshall Prime member meant no shipping costs & I could have this new fangled invention all up in my toddlers face tomorrow. So, I bought two because I try to learn from my past missteps. We got it the very next day. My son was thrilled to be able to lay down a drink all of the milk without the torture & struggle of non-weighted-straw cups. I was relieved to not have to deal with trying to explain gravity to an almost-3-year-old. So the highlight is obviously the weighted straw part. The straw itself is a nice soft & flexible yet durable plastic-y material, and it has the ""leak-proof"" thing inside the straw (you know, where it needs a bit of pressure to allow the liquid to flow through it). The lid has 2 side handles that make a click to let you know that it is closed good & tight, and uses a sliding mechanism on top to open/close the straw (pop-up type). The lid also comes in some nice bright colors- I got green for my son and pink for my daughter. The cup is clear and rather small... I think this could hold 6oz, but the straw & weight take up room, really it's just a bit under 6oz. I thought these were going to be a pain to clean, but low and behold, it comes with a teeny tiny straw scrubber brush! Fantastic! And now, what I didn't really like: The spill-proof thing inside the straw becomes wide-open after so many washes with the straw scrubber brush and not-so-spill-proof... in fact, my son has given himself & his baby sister a milk shower several times. This week. I also noticed that the other part of the straw that connects inside the lid (which also has some kind of spill-stopping magic powers apparently... I'm sorry I obviously don't know the proper terminology for sipping cup anatomy) eventually becomes loose too. My son has long-ago discovered that if he shakes his sippy cup hard enough, that spill-proof part inside comes loose and he can make it rain milk (yes, my son drinks milk exclusively). This eventually happens with any and all ""spill-proof"" sippy cups. But the straw becoming damaged from cleaning just makes it worse. Since my daughter never used her cup, I swapped the straws out after a month. Now it's been another month and I am just careful when I scrub that section inside the straw now and it's still holding up. I really liked the clicking of the lid closing, but after opening & closing so many times, the click isn't really noticable. This brings me to my issue of the size of the cup- it's too small for my kids! Seriously both of my kids act like they are going to pass out from dehydration if they don't have their cups filled with milk at all times. This means I'm constantly rinsing/washing/refilling this little cup all day long. It's cray. But this may be just a problem for my kids and might not be an issue for yours. Overall, I do really like these cups. They are perfect for little ones who like to lay back and have a drank. My son has thrown these cups at hardwood, concrete/cement, asphalt, brick walls/pathways, gravel, and marble and they have held up thus far... many many scratches & scuffs but not a single crack! Bravo! If you decide to buy one of these don't be like me and get carried away with excitement from the tiny straw scrubber brush; gently scrub the top half of the straw where the spill-proof whatever-you-call-it is and it should last you a lifetime...

My past favorite sheets has been of organic cotton which were significantly more in price however definitely past their lifespan at 6 years. Due to the increased cost of living, I started researching sheet sets as I do everything now and came across California Design Zen which had great reviews, higher thread count and other environmental factors that I look for. I was debating between the 400 and 600 thread count, however, picked the 400 due to the color available/size and the Amazon Deal of the day. The sheets were well packaged and heavy. These sheets actually fit my deep pillow top mattress better than my old high-end organic sheets! I love that the elastic is all around the fitted sheet as it seems to stay in place well. I washed the sheets first as the instructions recommended by themselves. The only thing that I would say that was of concern was that the sheets had a significant amount of lint in the dryer after the first wash. I haven't seen that much lint except when washing my fleece throws. They do have some wrinkles however may have been less if I had removed them from the dryer sooner. I'm fine with the wrinkles as the sheets are soft, maybe a little silky feel compared to my prior cotton sheets. I believe the silky feel is more along the lines of sateen sheets. Weight wise they are about the same as my organic cotton sheets. I am considering purchasing another set in the 600 thread count in a different color.

The sheets don't get any static electricity which a lot synthetic materials usually do, and even though it hasn't gotten super hot in California yet, I feel like these will work very well for the summer too.

This smart speaker not only maintains the convenience and features I've come to expect from the Echo Dot series but also introduces welcome improvements to its design and audio performance. The new spherical design is aesthetically pleasing and fits seamlessly into any room. The addition of the LED clock display is a practical and stylish touch, making it easy to glance at the time without relying on voice commands. The display also shows the temperature and timers, which I've found particularly useful in the kitchen. When it comes to audio performance, the All-New Echo Dot has significantly improved. The 5th Gen speaker boasts richer sound and deeper bass, making music, podcasts, and even Alexa's responses much more enjoyable to listen to. The device easily fills a room with clear, high-quality audio. Setup and integration with the Alexa app are as simple as ever, and the Echo Dot continues to support an extensive range of smart home devices, making it a versatile hub for home automation. Voice recognition is accurate and responsive, even in noisy environments. The only minor downside I've noticed is that the LED clock display could be brighter, making it easier to see during the day. However, this is a minor issue that doesn't detract from the overall performance and appeal of the device. In summary, the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) with clock is a fantastic addition to the Echo family, offering improved audio quality and a stylish design while maintaining the versatility and convenience that users have come to expect.

I originally purchased my first Echo because I was sleeping through my alarms, but no more of that! Not only can I set the alarms to be loud, but I got two Alexa-compatible light bulbs that turn on when my first alarm is dismissed.

I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre reading deeply into my recorded voice of me snoring and singing in the shower, but somehow, I ain‚Äôt too worried. I regularly forget to turn my wax melt off until I am out running errands, so an Alexa-compatible plug helps me with that. My fan is a table fan, as there is no ceiling fan in my bedroom, and Alexa even turns it on for me, turns out the compatible light bulbs, adjusts the speaker volume to 5, and then plays half an hour of the best sleep music I‚Äôve ever had to help lull me to sleep from Apple Music. Originally I had difficulty connecting Apple Music to Alexa, but once I disconnected everything and tried again it has worked perfectly since. Alexa even reminds me to take my nightly medicine, of which is much less effective when you regularly forget to take it (lol), and I am much more consistent and feeling better overall as a result of these medication reminders. When I go to visit my parents, they have to remind me to take them otherwise I still forget sometimes. I‚Äôve even used Alexa to help me get out of the shower in a timely fashion, as sometimes the hot water is extremely inviting and I lose track of time, so I‚Äôll just set a music timer and be on my way to an appointment on time.

I just get amazed that it is such a security device, 1) it can sense when someone is in the room and alert your phone. 2) it can be set to guard when you're away, will alert your phone no matter where your at, to smoke detection sounds, carbon monoxide warning alarms, again alert you if it detects motion. 3) it can even tell you the temperature of the room you have placed it, besides of course tell you the outside temperature 4) this is a bit techie and some might not find useful, but if and only if is the ""but"" to this, but if you have an eero router, this is more than capable of extending your wifi range, I have used it and it absolutely extended my signal , super speeds, no but enough for everyday use, YouTube, email Netflix, yes it produces strong enough for that, large files, gaming, wouldn't do, Bottom line for the extra security and piece of mind it provides it's cost is a drop in the bucket, and I would like to add before ending the review a thought on the Amazon and Alexa are spying on us, Well yes I suppose they could if they opted to, However, anything you use, your cell phone, your tablet, your laptop, by any maker, Google, Apple, Samsung and yes Amazon, if any of the above chose to break the strict laws, yes, it is a fact they could listen to you, any product with a microphone and wifi or cellular connection, the makers of that device could remotely listen, I gotta believe everyone knows this, So I often wonder why Alexa and Amazon take so much heat for this when as stated , ""any"" of the modern devices we use Could notice could do this, I just don't think these billion dollar companies want to take the risk of being destroyed by listening in on what we might be having for dinner or if we broke wind, lol I could see where if you were some major felon where you might be concerned, lol, but us everyday people, not so much, and remember the mafia rule, someone is always listening, so pass notes and burn the notes instantly after being read, sorry could not resist, lol, again bottom line is we live in a world of technology, and while it brings great features and skills, it all comes with a risk";Awesome features , long review but worth the read;real;real;B09B8W5FW7;88;Home & Kitchen;Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) with clock | Smart speaker with clock and Alexa | Cloud Blue;19806;4.7;10;2023-04-29 08:36:23.349

Echo dot 5 does not measure your indoor temperature nor displays the temperature of your city/location as it does with the time. It only temporarily displays the temperature for a couple of seconds when you use a vocal command to ask the temperature out there. It also does not find your wifi during setup if your cellphone is connected to a 5 ghz only router. I spent 30 minutes and couldn't setup my 5ghz wifi. I was able to setup a temporary wifi by connecting to a ""5ghz to 2.4 ghz wifi converter"" (this converter saved me so many times because many smart devices don't connect to 5ghz wifi and my internet provider got rid of 2.4 ghz band on the router that they offer and people don't know that their router has no 2.4 ghz until they try to connect a smart device to wifi). After connecting to the 2.4 ghz, I was able to switch the internet connection back to 5 ghz.

Ordered a complete whole home replacement 5th Gen DOTS/Clocks to replace our existing/outdated Google Smart Home MINI/Hub devices on 08JAN23 and arrived on 11JAN23 spent the next 30 minutes to 2.5 hours getting all devices placed into their respective places. This is the total time it took as I do have ROUTINES that are CUSTOM as I'll explain below: -SET UP CUSTOM AMBIENT LIGHTING -SET UP CUSTOM MUSIC FROM SPOTIFY PLAYLIST + PAIRING WITH BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS -SET UP CUSTOM GROUPS FOR DEVICES -SET UP CUSTOM NAMES FOR DEVICES EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO A GROUP (e.g.: LIVING ROOM TV, LANAI FAN, KITCHEN FAN, MASTER BEDROOM FAN as you want to be able to just say ALEXA turn off the Lanai Fan and she does it versus ALEXA turning off the lamps on the LANAI as well) -SETUP SKILLS FOR OUR SECURITY SYSTEM WERE SEAMLESS AND FAST Set up all the ROUTINES from my cell phone using the ALEXA APP and I love that you can COPY and SHARE routines with other DOTS as I use this feature to announce the TIME on the hour and a half an hour. Call me NUTS, but when you worked for 30+ years in the Airline industry and travel to many different Airports. It is a God send to hear the LOCAL TIME IS NOW being announced throughout the Airport. Another critical thing is before your AMAZON ECHO DOT arrives at your home. Download the APP and set it up on your cell or tablet and if you have an existing SMART HOME of devices (lights, plugs, tv, fan, microwave, refrigerator, washer, and driver) get them all dialed in as it was fast to do as we only use the GEENI APP with the Merkury Innovations Smart Home products and ALEXA has the GEENI Skills. This made last night's process of getting all the areas dialed into the ALEXA APP a breeze. I am ready to order another set of 5 devices to integrate into another home getting rid of GOOGLE once and for all. If you are on the fence like I was in buying these products, do your research, via YOUTUBE and watch the current video posted and do a GOOGLE search for the TOP features of ALEXA and again look at the most current stuff and NOT articles for 2015 to 2023 (LOL). This device runs circles around GOOGLE HOME and GOOGLE NEST/HUB Smart Home devices. Also, the PRIVACY is what I liked as you can set that up on the APP which has vastly improved from 2018 when I was planning this entire Smart Home thing for our family.

I guarantee most of these reviews that have heavily rusted and broken can openers are either rinsing them in water or running them through the dishwasher. Don't do that unless you want a broken rusted can opener and a future with you leaving a bad review. If you MUST clean them, use rubbing alcohol as it dries fast and wont destroy your opener. Either poor it straight on or put some in a spray bottle and spray it on. You will still get some rust over time but it will definitely last longer. After rinsing or spraying with the rubbing alcohol leave it opened and out to dry on a towel.

Here's my review of the pros and cons of using this neck pillow for traveling: Pros: Comfortable Support: The neck pillow provides excellent support to my neck and head, helping me maintain a more natural and comfortable position while resting during long flights or car rides. It helps prevent neck strain and discomfort, allowing me to arrive at my destination feeling refreshed and pain-free. Portability: The neck pillow is designed to be compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry with me wherever I go. It comes with a convenient travel bag or can be attached to my carry-on luggage, making it a convenient and hassle-free travel accessory. Versatility: The neck pillow is versatile and can be used in various travel situations, including flights, road trips, train rides, or even just for a quick nap at the airport. It provides support not only for the neck but can also be used as a cushion for lower back support or to prop up my head while sitting. Cons: Bulkiness: The neck pillow did not fit easily back into the bag that it comes with, i found it easier just to put it in my backpack. In conclusion, despite the storage bag it comes with, the benefits of using this neck pillow for traveling far outweigh this minor issue. I highly recommend investing in this neck pillow to enhance your travel experience and ensure a comfortable rest during your journeys!;Well worth the price;real;real;B07SRRQS5B;92;Home & Kitchen;napfun Neck Pillow for Traveling, Upgraded Travel Neck Pillow for Airplane 100% Pure Memory Foam Travel Pillow for Flight Headrest Sleep, Portable Plane Accessories, Light Grey;8063;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:36:54.845

However, once I undid the pull tab on the sleek waterproof bag that houses this magnificent neck pillow, it inflated like a novelty balloon handed to me by a not-so-scary clown. The smell of chocolate chip cookies was a little bit disturbing, but instructions read to allow the pillow to reinflate for 24 hours. I let this happen outside as to reduce the amount of chocolate chip cookie smell residue. Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate chip cookies. But my mom always told me not to eat in my bed, so to have a pillow that smells of cookies brings back some harsh memories that I will not get to in this review. The next day when I brought my pillow inside and placed it around my neck, I instantly fell to sleep. I didn't wake for 24 hours. Very effective. I used this on a plane, and in the middle seat it felt like I was on cloud native memory foam but only around my neck. It was effective and worth the price. It travels well and that sleek waterproof bag comes in handy when you're traveling with a bottle of water that likes to spread its internal joy inside your backpack.;Fresh baked pillow;real;real;B07SRRQS5B;92;Home & Kitchen;napfun Neck Pillow for Traveling, Upgraded Travel Neck Pillow for Airplane 100% Pure Memory Foam Travel Pillow for Flight Headrest Sleep, Portable Plane Accessories, Light Grey;8063;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:36:54.845

Total travel time from the time I left home to the time I arrived at my destination was a little over 30 hours. As you can see, I needed to make sure I would be able to sleep on the plane. The pillow is comfortable and made my long trip bearable. The memory foam doesn‚Äôt take long to reshape and is easy to roll and fit into the case. The material over the memory foam is very soft. There is a lock on each strap. The locks easily lock into each other with a click and as easily unlock. However, I did not find that this pillow provides total all-around support for the neck, especially in the front. My chin was dropping down a little, not as much as without the pillow; however, this did not prevent me from being able to sleep during my flights. The pillow also seems to be a bit too bulky and a little uncomfortable in the back. Because of that, my back wasn‚Äôt flash against the back of the seat preventing me from being able to sleep unless the seat was reclined all the way. Overall, this neck pillow is not perfect.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c83;R3AQCWHSORW3SD;;2023-04-16;TRUE;B01N1QE5ME;5.0;The BEAUTERAL steamer works really well, in general, but, especially well for clothes (drapes, bedspreads, etc.) that are too bulky to lay out on an ironing board, or that are made of a fabric that could 'melt' using a standard iron that's set too hot. Placing the metal plate (of the steamer unit) against your article of clothing, and gliding it across the fabric while steaming does a fine job of smoothing out the wrinkles. Being a seamstress, I use my standard iron regularly and find this steamer to be a much-needed alternative. Many times, maneuvering a standard iron across certain fabrics (like chiffon, taffeta, silk) has been iffy. The delicate fabric is prone to burn or melt if the iron's heat surges, unless you place another piece of thin fabric over the item to be pressed, which then becomes cumbersome. This steamer does the trick without that worry. One suggestion to other users...please use DISTILLED WATER...EVERY TIME you use the steamer. The instructions state that it's designed for use with Tap Water, unless you have hard water, in which case use distilled. I wouldn't take a chance. I nearly ruined a couple dresses by using tap water in my standard iron years ago. The calcium in the water creates deposits inside the iron, and then spits them out when the iron heats up. The distilled water doesn't leave residue. Also, empty the water reservoir after each use, prop the little rubber stopper open, and invert it on a dishrack, or some such, letting it dry completely before storing it.;Very nice handheld steamer.;real;real;B01N1QE5ME;93;Home & Kitchen;BEAUTURAL Steamer for Clothes, Portable Handheld Garment Fabric Wrinkles Remover, 30-Second Fast Heat-up, Auto-Off, Large Detachable Water Tank;53076;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:37:02.914

This portable handheld garment fabric wrinkles remover has been a reliable companion on many of my movie sets, ensuring that every costume is as smooth and wrinkle-free as the day it was made. One of the most impressive features of this device is its lightning-fast 30-second heat-up time, enabling you to swiftly tackle any wardrobe malfunction that may arise. The large detachable water tank allows for an extended steaming session, making it perfect for steaming multiple garments at once. However, every great story has its share of conflict, and the BEAUTURAL Steamer is no exception. Occasionally, this otherwise stellar device may spit out water instead of steam, resulting in a few unexpected splashes. While it's certainly not a deal-breaker, it does require a bit of extra caution during use. Despite this minor flaw, the BEAUTURAL Steamer's auto-off feature ensures safety and peace of mind, making it an essential tool for both professional and personal use. As a director, I value the importance of the smallest details, and the BEAUTURAL Steamer helps me achieve the polished look I desire. With that in mind, I am pleased to award the BEAUTURAL Steamer for Clothes a well-deserved 4-star rating.

I love to travel with this blender...it fits my needs very well. Highly recommend with the warning of the top`s ability to seal without pressure.

I am blown away by how amazing my salad spinner spins my salad, and I'm thrilled to give it a glowing 5-star review! The spinning action of this salad spinner is out of this world! It's lightning fast and incredibly effective at removing excess water from my salad greens. With just a few quick spins, my greens come out perfectly dry and crisp, ready to be dressed with my favorite vinaigrette. No more soggy salads for me! The power of the spin is truly impressive. The centrifugal force generated by this salad spinner is remarkable, and it's a joy to watch the water being flung out of the bowl as my greens spin to perfection. It's not only efficient, but also fun to use! I find myself eagerly reaching for my salad spinner every time I make a salad, just to experience the sheer satisfaction of seeing my greens emerge so beautifully dry. The quality of this salad spinner is also outstanding. It's made from durable materials that are built to last, and the parts are well-designed and easy to use. The large capacity allows me to spin a substantial amount of greens at once, making it perfect for gatherings or when I'm meal prepping. The clear bowl and easy-to-use brake button add to its convenience and functionality. Cleanup is a breeze as well. The parts of this salad spinner are dishwasher safe, making it effortless to keep it clean and ready for my next salad-making adventure. I appreciate the thoughtful design that takes into consideration the practicalities of everyday use. In summary, this salad spinner has exceeded my expectations in every way. Its amazing spinning action, durability, and ease of use have made my salad preparation process more efficient and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fresh, crisp salads without the excess water. It's a game-changer, and I can't imagine my kitchen without it.

So glad I did. The quality is actually better. The plastic of the bowl is thicker and the nonskid bottom is made so that no water can get in and cause mold, unlike my old one. The basket is also a better quality. The top is now constructed so that it can dry better than the old model, and I like that it‚Äôs clear so you can tell if it does get dirty.

Before I start bragging on this thing, I am by no way endorsed by Ninja or getting paid by them. I've owned a few Ninja products blenders and still have one that's over 10 years old. They make quality machines. This fryer is a life & time saver...especially if you're a lazy cook. I have been researching air fryers for the past few months and nothing comes close to the Ninja. The basket size isn't the large 5+ quart capacity like the bigger fryers, (Ninja is only 4qt), but this thing cooks so fast you won't miss the extra 1 qt. It comes w/ a crisper that works perfectly, a recipe book and a multi-layer rack. The first night I had it I made wings and I tell you that I will NEVER buy fried chicken again!!! Yes, they were that crispy and tasted much better. I bought the Louisiana fried chicken flour from Walmart, battered the wings, spritzed w/ a little olive oil and had fried chicken in 10 minutes. No greasy mess, no 3rd degree burns from hot oil, and your house doesn't smell like a chicken joint for 4 days afterward. Because the Ninja uses a ceramic coating on their fryers the clean up is very easy. Next, I made sweet potato fries! Had a bag of frozen ones in the freezer and popped those babies in for 10 min. They were crispier than McDonald's. I tried homemade fries but the procedure takes too long. You have to peel, slice, soak potatoes, dry them...I'm just ready to pop them in the fryer and eat! It has been nonstop air fryer cooking in this house! I hit youtube to get a few recipes and it's been on ever since. What I like best about this fryer is it has a dehydrator feature and how fast it cooks. Frozen chicken wings? No problem! Throw them in the fryer for 10 minutes and they're defrosted. I've cooked pizza, fries, wings, reheated food, fried zucchini, and tonight I baked a chocolate cake. Everything came out perfect! Next up is donuts! The only thing I don't like about this fryer is 30 seconds after it finishes cooking it shuts off. I know this is a safety feature but I always have more items to cook. In 2 weeks, I have used my microwave twice, and that was to reheat coffee. Before I forget, I did cinnamon rolls too! I used the canned Pillsbury ones and it normally takes 20 min in the oven. In the Ninja? 8 minutes and that's if you like them brown. I actually could have stopped it at 5 min and they would be perfect. My house smelled like a Cinnabon factory!üòõ I have used every feature on this fryer except the dehydrator but I'll be making beef jerky soon. Overall, I am VERY pleased! The best selling feature was the price & the size. The Ninja is much slimmer than some of the bulkier fryers and fits under my cabinet nicely. I'm also happy it only used 1500W unlike some of the larger fryers that burn 1800 which could kill your light bill. The outside of the fryer doesn't get hot so you won't have to worry about getting burned but do take caution when taking your food out. Is it loud? My exhaust fan on my stove is louder than the Ninja. The extension cord on it is long so you don't have to worry about being limited on where you can place it. I think I've covered everything? This thing is THE BOMB! If you're wondering what cookware you can use, just about anything you place in a microwave you can put in the Ninja. I went to the Dollar Tree and bought a few 7"" foil pans I use to reheat food & bake in. Also, grab you some silicone tongs while you're there so you don't scratch the surface of your fryer.

I've used toaster ovens, standard ovens, and toasters over the years and never felt any were convenient, fast, AND versatile. Turns out THIS is what I've been looking for all these years. It's easy to use, though I am finding cook times vary. I read the manual on time and temp suggestions but some things ended up way under or overcooked, I just started estimating it on my own and checking temps with a meat thermometer. So it was a bit of a learning curve figuring out what cooks in what time, but once you get that figured you know right away what to do and from then on it's AMAZING. It has a very fast preheat compared to conventional or even toaster oven, a very fast cook time, is much easier to clean (no more scrubbing baking trays daily), and huge bonus - takes up very little space in a tight kitchen like ours. It is perfect for quick snacks, reheats, or meal sides for a family of four. Reheats refrigerated fast food fries to taste almost as good the next day and makes CRISPY burritos in record time.

It cooks fast, cleans up very easily and the instructions are more superior than they were before. It is also perfect for a single person.

Finally, and maybe most important, it had to have really good reviews. We found this one and have been using it like crazy. It met all our requirements. Pretty reasonable price too.

644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c87;R1DNZ7HVI15KFS;;2023-04-23;TRUE;B0869D64HL;4.0;I bought two of these beds for the visit of my two grandchildren, ages 10 & 11. The beds could be blown up and deflated after use easily, and were comfortable. They could be adjusted to a desired hardness. The drawbacks is that one of the beds did deflate a little during the night, but more air could easily be let in. There is a simple inflating dial at the foot of the bed. I supervised the kids while they inflated them, which they found fun to do. The sides are 18‚Äù deep, so it is important to purchase sheets that will fit onto them without coming off. I was able find them online, on sale at Macy‚Äôs. Overall, the kids loved the beds, were comfortable and I would buy these again. They seem very good for children.;Great Guest Beds;real;real;B0869D64HL;97;Home & Kitchen;INTEX 64411ED Dura-Beam Deluxe Comfort-Plush Elevated Air Mattress: Fiber-Tech ‚Äì Twin Size ‚Äì Built-in Electric Pump ‚Äì 18in Bed Height ‚Äì 300lb Weight Capacity;8091;4.3;10;2023-04-29 08:37:34.186

We fully inflated it once and then had to add a little bit more air after our grandson bounced on it. He's done that since then and it's holding air and staying firm. The baffle construction inside the air bed helps a lot. We have another larger air bed that is low to the floor if we need it, but this one is superior to that bed. It's firm on the sides and has a little indented lip all around to keep him from falling out. If he does roll out, it's not far on to the carpet because it's only 18 inches high. My husband (200 lbs) laid down on it and said it was comfortable. I highly recommend this bed, especially as an extra bed for children.;Great Extra Bed for Guests;real;real;B0869D64HL;97;Home & Kitchen;INTEX 64411ED Dura-Beam Deluxe Comfort-Plush Elevated Air Mattress: Fiber-Tech ‚Äì Twin Size ‚Äì Built-in Electric Pump ‚Äì 18in Bed Height ‚Äì 300lb Weight Capacity;8091;4.3;10;2023-04-29 08:37:34.186
644cb0b4edd6fb90e1883c87;R3VEACBLDORURQ;;2022-11-22;TRUE;B0869D64HL;4.0;I bought this because I needed a quick, easy, DURABLE sleeping surface for when I'm at my friend's house each weekend. I stay at a friend's every Friday and Saturday night to help them at their nude campground. They allow me to sleep in their living room of the main house - however the little couch (loveseat) was really killing me to sleep on. They had an air mattress that they got for me...a real nice one - a Beautyrest. VERY comfortable! However after a few weekends of sleeping on it, it started losing air throughout the night. It got to the point where I'd wake up in the morning almost touching the ground. So I said I'd buy another air mattress and we threw that one away. After some research and considering my budget I decided on this one. I've now slept on it for 2 weekends - 5 nights. I'm definitely impressed with the built-in pump! Very quick and easy to inflate and deflate! I also love that you can stash the wire away in a little compartment in the pump! Definitely a plus! I was also very impressed with the fact that it did not seem to lose ANY air over the course of a whole weekend. I've slept on MANY air mattresses through the years and even really nice, BRAND new ones seem a little softer in the morning than it was after inflating it the night before. This one seems to hold air perfectly! Now, I can't speak to the longevity of this product yet, but consider me impressed so far! My ONLY complaint is that it's really not all that comfortable. Now I know it's an air mattress so obviously my expectations aren't super high but I've slept on much more comfortable ones in the past. My first night I inflated it to the max. It was quite hard and difficult to sleep on my sides. So the next night I tried letting a little air out and that definitely helped. But it still wasn't as comfortable as I'd have liked. Anyway, for a very inexpensive air mattress, I was very impressed! I'm just going to buy a memory foam mattress topper for it and BAM - problem solved! I would definitely recommend!

It sprung a leak, and I had no idea where, but it would deflate on me while I slept to the point where I could feel it deflating, and I would wake up with my hips on the floor and my feet and head held high by the pressure, and it was awkward to try and get off to reinflate. I would have to do this every few hours.

644cb0efedd6fb90e1883cf0;R8W942F2J3SF3;;2023-04-14;TRUE;B001CJVTLC;5.0;I was curious about these random cards as to what sets they were from and if they were real. I accidentally ordered two packs but I wasn't too concerned and just wanted to see what I could get. From what I can tell, they are real cards. A few had a little damage on a corner but they were far better condition than what I expected. Out of the two packs, I only got one Sword and Shield Base Set energy card, six sets of duplicate cards, and a few trainer cards. Completely fine with it, I expected some duplicates and this is only to satisfy my Pokemon TCG itch in an attempt to spend less money on specific booster packs. Besides the SWSH base set energy card, I got 11 Vivid Voltage, 5 Battle Styles, 6 Brilliant Stars, and the rest as Fusion Strike cards. Most cards were commons, come uncommons, and I think three rares. No reverses or holos in my particular packs. I actually received quite a few cards that I did not yet have in my spotty sets so I might order again.;Real cards, good variety;real;real;B001CJVTLC;2;Toys & Games;Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from Every Series, 50 Cards in Each Lot;56863;4.3;10;2023-04-29 08:38:09.407

The interactive feature sets this book apart from other children's books. My child can press the pictures to hear the name of the animal, its sound, and even learn some interesting facts about each creature. My child enjoys hearing the various sounds the animals make because the voice is clear and engaging. The book is also sturdy and well-made, which is important in children's toys. Despite frequent use and occasional drooling and throwing, it has held up well. If you're a parent or caregiver looking for a fun and educational toy for your child, I wholeheartedly recommend the LeapFrog 100 Animals Book.

It looks like there is not enough green sections too make it look full like the box picture. This is the only Lego product that I have seen this much of a difference. I am rather disappointed in the finished product. As with most higher level Lego kits the instructions leave a little to be figured out in some sections. One problem area is after finishing the trunk it seems solid until get gets weight from the upper green sections. The trunk came apart in a weak section under this extra weight, I was 95% done and it is near impossible to get the pieces to stay, There just is not enough surface tension in the pieces to hold the counterweight.

Well, we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in. It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square! To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing. I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together. (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday. On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it! She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there. I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in. Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it. It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult. But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else! If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self. üòú EDIT: 01/24/23 - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas. Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks. It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams. So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer. After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer. I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity. We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. üò¢;Frustrating for old farts!

I tried it out a few times on the wheel, making some miniature sized pots and vases. So far, it's been a success! Amazing! Still waiting for the pieces to dry to see if there's cracking. (Update: it dries perfectly well! Has a bone white color, no shrinkage or cracking that I can see. However I noticed sometimes there are tiny air bubbles that form on the surface and pop if a lot of water is used while throwing. The holes left behind are extremely tiny so not a deal breaker for me, but others may mind.) However the clay can definitely be centered, shaped, and pulled up. I work at really small sizes so I'm not sure how well this clay would work at a medium to large size. But for miniature pottery (1""-2"" diameter) it has worked great! Not all air dry clay works on the pottery wheel, so I'm very impressed. Jovi, for example, is great for hand building but it didn't retain any texture and couldn't be pulled up.

644cb0efedd6fb90e1883cfa;RYGHJG2K6LFLQ;;2023-04-12;TRUE;B073WMYP6M;5.0;Yes, yes yes! Please. Ok, so my headline sounds like something naughty. It's just a floatie. But it would not be good for kids. I think kids would end up trashing the mesh. And a small kid may have trouble using it. People were envious of my floatie. Now while floaties were allowed at my hotel pool in Puerto Vallarta, I do know they aren't everywhere. But this one is fairly discreet and is not larger than the body, so therefore doesn't bother anyone else. I am going to attempt to take it on my cruise in June. I will definitely be able to use it in the sea when at port. (I will try it in the adult pool on the ship) In fact, I think I need to get one for my friend so she doesn't feel left out. I cannot recommend this enough if you like floating. It's small and easy to bring along. One reviewer said they even left theirs behind at the end of the trip with some other folks to make room in their luggage. Brilliant idea. Share the floatie love. Bring more souvenirs home. Buy yourself a new one for your next trip. Think of all the extra Mexican vanilla I could have bought! LOL! Ok, not that much because this floatie takes up very little space....;Take this on your trip!

It's lightweight & packs small in a suitcase, but was a huge benefit in the pool! It's very comfortable to lie on ~ I'm 5'5"", & I could rest my head on one pillow (hair stayed dry), while my knees were supported by the other pillow & my calves hung in the water. You can also sit on it, either saddle-style, or as a sling seat with a pillow under each arm. It feels high quality, so altho I've only used it for one trip, I think it will last a while. The only issue is that it was hard to inflate ~ I couldn't do it, & my husband had some trouble but managed. It felt as if something was blocking the air from going in. Hopefully now that we've used it, it will be easier next time. But once inflated, it held the air all week thru daily use, & was fairly straightforward to deflate.

644cb0efedd6fb90e1883cfa;RTFMB1168V82X;;2023-02-04;TRUE;B073WMYP6M;5.0;My wife and I recently had the pleasure of using these pool float chairs during our trip to Cancun and I must say, it was the perfect addition to our pool hangout experience. The lightweight and durable performance fabric made it easy to transport to and from the pools, and the quick valves allowed me to inflate and deflate it in no time. Spending the day floating in the warm waters of Cancun was made even better by the comfort and support provided by the headrest and footrest with their removable pillows. The mesh hammock sling kept us cool and comfortable, allowing us to drift off into a peaceful state of relaxation. One of my favorite things about this product was its versatility. I was able to switch between using it as a hammock and as a chair, depending on my mood. The fact that I could fold it up while inflated for quick transport or use the included carry bag for deflated storage made it even more convenient to use. Overall, I highly recommend the Aqua Leisure 4 in 1 Inflatable Monterey Hammock Pool Float Chair for anyone looking to enhance their beach or pool experience. Whether you're looking to relax in the sun, float in the pool, or enjoy a good book, this product has got you covered.

All the small pieces are perfect to play with and teaches the kids about sinking and floating. Sometimes I add a pitcher of hot water to warm it if needed. It is also easy to drain to avoid mosquitoes and doesn't required a lot of water to fill.

644cb0efedd6fb90e1883d01;R2ZCF9G1WLOMQ8;;2022-10-07;TRUE;B09T6QFR2J;4.0;"These balloons are great! I purchased these for my son's 2nd birthday party which was a Buzz Lightyear ""TWO Infinity and Beyond"" theme. I got three of sets in different colors...NAVY BLUE, WHITE, and LIME GREEN (the purple balloons in the photos were purchased from a different seller). I was very pleased with all of them! They were very easy to inflate, I did have an electric balloon pump which made the whole process much easier and faster. Out of all of the balloons we used, we only had one...yes ONE...balloon pop (lime green). I LOVED that each set arrived its own little box and all of the different sizes were separated into individual bags which was so great because the purple balloons (different seller) were all thrown into a single bag and I had to sit and sort through them. I used all four sizes in each color on the arch and they all looked great. It's been a full week since we put the arch together and almost every balloon still looks as good as the days we set it up!! Only a handful of 5inch balloons have deflated over the past week. In the future, now that I know they still look great after a week, I would be comfortable inflating/setting up a balloon arch 1-2 days prior to the party rather than rushing on the day of. NAVY BALLOONS (metallic): - Metallic which was the perfect contrast to the white and lime green which were not metallic. - The 18inch navy balloon was less metallic than the other sizes but it wasn't enough of a difference to keep me from using it. You can see the difference in the photo of the navy balloons. - The 5inch navy balloons seemed to be a little more sheer than the other sizes in that color. - All of the navy balloons did have a dusty/chalky film on them. Most of that disappeared while handling the balloons but I did go back after the arch was complete to wipe some of them off that still had the film on them. If I didn't wipe it off it was noticeable and looked dull instead of metallic. It really didn't take much time or effort to wipe them down. LIME GREEN BALLOONS: - Perfect color for Buzz Lightyear! - They aren't too sheer but you do see the dot on the top of them once inflated (see photo) which I'm told you don't get with higher end products. - They are much more sheer if you have lighting behind/to the side of them. We had this positioned next to a sliding door and decided to close some of the curtains so the sunny light didn't make them sheer. Keeping the curtains closed definitely made the colors more bold. WHITE BALLOONS: - While I was going through the balloons and stretching them prior to inflating them, I found that several of them had a weird, greasy, tan-colored substance on them. It honestly grossed me out and I wish I took a picture of it but I was in such a rush at that time that I didn't think of it. I checked the rest of them and they were fine. In total, it was probably 3-4 of the 12inch white balloons that had this issue. - They aren't too sheer but you do see the dot on the top of them once inflated (see photo) which I'm told you don't get with higher end products. This is not nearly as noticeable on the white as it was on the lime green. - They are much more sheer if you have lighting behind/to the side of them.

Not only was this a wonderful and mindful building experience, but the finished product has exceeded all of my expectations. The intricacy and attention to detail in this LEGO model are astonishing. From the white and pink flowers to the five leaves and two wandering air roots, it truly captures the essence of a real orchid. The blue fluted vase is a gorgeous touch, and the brown LEGO elements used to represent the bark mix add an extra layer of authenticity to the overall display. What I love most about this LEGO model is that it's so much easier to maintain than real flowers. There's no need to worry about watering, sunlight, or temperature ‚Äì it looks just as vibrant and lifelike every day. I've received countless compliments on this beautiful piece! In summary, the LEGO Orchid is a fantastic addition to any home d√©cor. Not only does it provide a relaxing and enjoyable building experience, but the end result is a stunning, low-maintenance floral display that will impress everyone who sees it. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking to add a touch of natural beauty to their home without the fuss of caring for real flowers.

644cb0efedd6fb90e1883d07;RXMUF6PZABUC0;;2023-02-22;TRUE;B07H48YNJ2;5.0;My 8 year old has trouble with expressing himself verbally when he is emotional. I picked up the purple octopus and a corgi to help him express being sad or frustrated in a non-verbal way so I could understand what he needs. Its hard to know what is going on - is he confused, is it a tantrum, does he need to calm down, or is he about to cry and need a hug? Holding the stuffed toy shows me I am sad and need a hug and need you to stop talking so I can process. Got it! Plus the toy even enables him to express verbally what he is feeling more often and in a better way. This was really helpful for him and our family. Worth every penny and I am sure we have the authentic product - very well sewn.

There was a major difference when I compared it to my other Ariel doll‚Äôs that I‚Äôve recently bought.

The problem is, she was always bored in the shower since she can't play with boats and other bath toys. I decided to make shower time more exciting with these cute spinners that can suction to the wall. They are great and make shower time much easier and we skip the fight for a bath more often than not. My only problem is that they tend to ""unstick"" to the shower walls in the middle of the night after a shower and it sounds like something horrible breaking or exploding and startles me awake almost every single time (bathroom is in my bedroom). If the suction was better (like some other toys I have in the shower that have been stuck for way longer) I would give these 5 stars.

Some of the colors within a color group are VERY similar, almost identical, and the only difference is the shade being slightly different, especially when you've just colored with them (i.e. the paper hasn't sat and dried). For instance with the blues, there are two or three blues that are almost exactly the same but maybe one is just barely 1/2 a shade lighter. The violets are identical. But even with that, there is still a lot of colors. Most of the markers had good saturation, good ink levels and weren't dried out, but there were a couple that you had to work a little harder at it or they would be patchy. The names are creative and might tell you the basic color group but not much more than that. The packaging is wasteful and not practical for actually storing the markers.

First impression was it was soft and flexible which is a plus so you could pack them for travel without taking much space at all.

They both didn‚Äôt cry or complain that it hurt at all when thrown at lower body which I was worried about. When it hit my youngest in the neck by accident she did cry a bit but stopped shortly after. I did buy the 12 pack just to see if I liked it and we definitely did. They are a bit on the pricey side but I can see how it makes up from having to run and refill at the hose or running out of the quick fill ones right away. At the end the kids were happy they didn‚Äôt have to go out and find all the pieces in the grass. Our dog was able to get a hold of 2 and they ripped right away but she was just trying to get in the fun. A family member did ask where I bought them and I directed them to the exact link.

My just 2 year old grandson was so excited to receive the bubble gun but he could not wrap his little hand around the gun and pull the trigger. I taped the trigger down for continuous bubbles (like a bubble machine) but discovered that he liked to be in control of starting and stoping the bubbles. I subsequently bought a bubble maker with a push button trigger (shark bubble blower, also on Amazon) which made all the difference in the world. My grandson was able to use the push button trigger with ease and no frustration.

You can even dilute it more than they say and you still get strong bubbles that last and float really well. - the bubbles this solution makes are in some way thicker, prettier, and more impressive than bubbles made with a dish soap solution. - they are also really sticky and the solution has a very VERY high lather - as such, do NOT use this indoors. Whatever ingredient makes the high lather and mega bubbles is also super difficult to clean off of/out of absolutely anything and everything. A friend of mine didn't listen despite being warned repeatedly and she says it took her several days to get her floors and counters cleaned, and soapy patches still sometimes appear when she mops. DO NOT USE THIS STUFF INSIDE. In conclusion: this is powerful, really effective bubble solution that will make your OUTDOOR bubble time super fun and amazing! Despite being a nightmare to get out of indoor surfaces, I haven't had any issues with clothes being stained when using this solution - however, I do dilute the solution more than advised, so that may help as well.

Beyond those pretty minor grievances, this wound up being much more than I was expecting. The seller clearly puts a lot of energy into ensuring there's order here, in spite of the randomized nature of the set. Example? My set has 3 rarities, more than 5 foils, multiple trainers, multiple items, multiple energies, etc.; all with nearly no duplicates. And, though the cards aren't brand new, they are almost universally in mint condition. Plus, there was genuinely more than 50 cards here (I counted 53), and a handful of familiar Pokemon faces in the deck. While you might not end up with a Pikachu or Charizard, this is a solid investment; especially if (like me) you're seeing the set on sale for 50+ percent off.

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d32;R9DHN8UH385B1;;2010-08-13;TRUE;B00000ISC5;4.0;"After being barraged by the commercials on television, I ordered this Live Butterfly Garden for my son's birthday. First, buyers should understand exactly WHAT you will get in the initial ""Live Butterfly Garden"" pack: 1. A butterfly habitat ""pop-up"" tent, which is made of a mesh material on the sides, a plastic lid with a zipper to open on top, and a solid material bottom. 2. A butterfly food ""feeder"". This is a little plastic dropper. Once your butterflies emerge from their cocoons, you will need to make a mixture of water and sugar to feed them. This kit does not bring food for the butterflies once they have transformed. You will have to make it yourself, which is easy enough. 3. A post-card (mail-in) coupon and an instruction pamphlet. It is important to realize that you will need to mail-in a redemption coupon in order to actually receive the caterpillars. When THIS kit is delivered to your house, it does not have the caterpillars inside the box. You can also call the company (with out waiting to mail in your postcard), or you can go to their online website and place your order. That's what I did - the online ordering system asks you to enter a unique code that comes with your initial kit. There was an additional processing and handling fee of $3.00 that I had to pay for them to ship the actual caterpillars to my house (I live in Florida). One thing that I think ALL people who are thinking about ordering this set should keep in mind is... these are REAL LIVE animals. It makes sense that they would not be able to keep them in a box in some warehouse somewhere until the kit sells. By that time... well, let's just say that the animals inside probably wouldn't make it. So, you get this kit, and then you send away (or call or go online) to request your caterpillars. We did all that. A few weeks later, a TINY little box came. Now, here is where I personally had a little problem. I live in a gated community, and every house has a little metal mail box with a lock & key. Packages that are too big to fit in these boxes are delivered directly to our doors. However, if a package will fit into the little metal mailbox, the postal carrier will leave it there. Well, being a busy Mom, I sometimes do not check my mail EVERY day. It must have been 4 days before it dawned on me... OH! I ordered that butterfly - caterpillar thing! I RAN out to my metal ""community"" mailbox, and sure enough... there was a tiny box inside. Upon opening the tiny box, I found a little clear plastic container. Inside the container was a bunch of brown stuff (which turned out to be the caterpillar food), tons of brownish looking spider webby stuff, 3 crispy things (cocoons, or chrysalides) and 2 REALLY BIG caterpillars. Shocked and mortified, I called the customer service phone number immediately. I spoke to a nice man who explained that due to the extremely hot summer, the entire life cycle was sped up (during shipping, and no doubt sitting in my mailbox). It turns out that 3 of the caterpillars had already spun themselves into cocoons, and the other two had already eaten and grown to their maximum size. The customer service guy was really nice and he arranged to have another set sent out to me, FREE of charge. He recommended that we schedule it for another time of the year, so we settled on October. This man was so kind; he took the time to answer all of my questions and didn't make me feel like a dope for asking. I'm sure he's had SEVERAL calls like mine... but he was extremely apologetic and sincere. He made me feel better about the whole thing. Well, here I had already called my son to come and look at his new ""pets"" BEFORE opening the little box. There was no going back. He looked inside, and said ""EWE!"" He also told me that it did NOT look like it did on the commercials. The food was supposed to be sand - ours was a brown, jelly like goop. There were webs (it was actually silk) all inside and the cocoons were NOT attached to the top (like they were supposed to be). What was I going to do? I decided to keep the little container and follow the instructions. I pretended like nothing was wrong! Maybe we could save the two big caterpillars and still have the experience, I thought to myself. I will not go into any more detail about the wonder of it all - you will just have to get your own kit! I will, however, tell you that ALL of our butterflies hatched! Once they were inside our cool house... nature took its course (we keep the a/c cranked to about 70 all day, and about 65 at night). Maybe the cooler air helped them to survive. It has been in the high 90's here in Florida... probably about 120 degrees in that mailbox! DESPITE the weird start to these little creatures' lives... they really turned out to be an amazing experience. They all came out perfect. Once they had transformed into butterflies, we actually kept them for a few weeks, feeding them a sugar and water ""nectar"" that we made. The whole thing was messier than I had anticipated. The ""pop up"" tent definitely needs to be washed out BEFORE the other replacement caterpillars get shipped to us in October. The butterflies secret this red stuff from their bottoms (the instructions stress that this stuff is NOT blood) and it dripped all down the sides of the habitat. The home-made nectar was sticky after a few days and got all over the bottom and the sides of the tent. (I used brown sugar because that was all I had on hand, so I'm sure that didn't help the cleanliness issue.) Depending on the age of the recipient, it can and will make an impact upon young minds. My son is 9... so he was old enough to stick his arm in the tent and feed them (while they fluttered around his hands!) Anyway, that brings me back to my point that these ARE live creatures, little animals. They require CARE and you DO have to feed them. Then there is the issue of feeding them without letting them free in your house. This kit DOES live up to the hype. You just need to be ready for what ever nature throws in your direction! Also, in the event you DO get a ""dud"", the customer service for this product is top notch. It's well worth the price, and Amazon DOES have the best price around.";LIVE BUTTERFLY DRAMA - Everything you should know before buying;real;real;B00000ISC5;68;Toys & Games;Insect Lore - Butterfly Growing Kit - Butterfly Habitat Kit with Voucher to Redeem 5 Caterpillars, STEM Journal, Butterfly Feeder & More ‚Äì Life Science & STEM Education ‚Äì Butterfly Science Kit;20619;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:46:55.638

Children nowadays are so technology driven and quick to pick it up. My Granddaughter was always trying to get Mom & Dads cell phones so she could take pictures; she loves this camera. It is very easy to use and has lots of features; although some of them are a little gimmicky. It offers still photos, video, cute little digital frames, and even a video style game or two. While a 3 year old can easily use it to take photos or even video, the extra features like frames and games are better suited for a child a little older. The camera is small, but still features a digital screen in addition to the traditional viewfinder, which makes it easier for younger kids to see what they want to take a picture of. Most of our photos come out with a finger partially in screen, but this is a learning experience and I‚Äôm sure pictures will improve over time. Please make sure you set your expectations of the quality of picture; these are not going to be high quality photos, but they aren‚Äôt bad either.

The sash is super cute too. It is one straight piece; not sewn. A safety pin was provided to secure the ends of it together, thereby making it somewhat adjustable.

You peel it off of it's paper backing, then secure the stick to the back of it with two clear sticky circles that were provided. It's very glittery; it looked great and held up nicely when stuck into the cake. The candles were beautiful and just the right size for our small-ish cake. The whole set came in a really nice box that had Birthday Greetings on it. This set was super sweet, inexpensive, and exactly what we were looking for. Additional info : Even though the cake topper is extremely glittery, and the sash has a fine shimmery-glittery finish, none of it sheds any loose glitter whatsoever.

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d38;R1R8DHZURXM32W;;2023-04-17;TRUE;B0BJV9L66K;5.0;"My baby boy has just turned 3 months old and STILL hated tummy time. None of my kids previously had ever had so much disdain for tummy time as he does. He's a lap baby, pure and simple. I've tried everything and more and was willing to spend whatever it took to find something that would engage him and encourage longer bouts of tummy time. This did it for him! The only downside is that he tries so hard to eat the toys inside the mat that he gets frustrated and starts crying! Luckily, this only happens after he starts getting bored with looking around. It gets/stays cold if you leave the water in it, which I think will be nice during the summer heat. But I cover half of it with a blanket when he lays on it for now. As others have suggested, I plan to change the water weekly to prevent any gunk build up. It DOES smell when opened, but I would not say it has a ""chemical"" smell... it smells like any plastic blow up toy you've encountered your entire life. I mean, it's the same smell as the beach balls my mom bought for us in the 80s, or the floaties she got my baby sister in the 90s! The smell eventually goes away. Honestly, I feel this mat will last longer than just tummy time stages. It's an amazing sensory toy and it feels like it's built well.

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d39;R633HHBFAIKNU;;2021-08-10;TRUE;B07P6MZPK3;5.0;Remember when families and friends actually played board games, and card games? Instead of a living room with no conversation, just a bunch of people tapping and swiping their phones? Well getting this UNO set can help you relive some of the magic from the good old days. When everyone actually had fun and interacted with each other. Believe it or not, I forgot how to play UNO. Which is weird, considering how much I played it when I was younger. Even as a young adult. But just like riding a bike, you never really lose it. Open the tin, break out the cards and the rule sheet. And in a minute, it all came back. So easy to play, that even toddlers can participate. BONUS TIP: HOW TO GET EVEN THE SMALLEST KIDS INVOLVED So Mattel recommends that kids ages 7 and up can play. But any kid 4-6 can most likely grasp the basic rules, as long as they can recognize numbers. The catch is that it may not hold the attention of a five year old all that great. But there's a way that you can still put the UNO cards to good use, while enjoying some bonding time with your little ones. Here's what I figured out, after a couple of games of UNO with our Little Girl.... Make it a memory game. What I did was go through the cards, and picked out two identical ones for different numbers/colors. So two green 5 cards. Two red 4 cards. Two blue 2 cards. Two yellow 7 cards. I tried to avoid sixes and nines. Basically take eight to twelve cards in total. Then place them in two to three rows, face down (UNO side up). I'd ask our Daughter to flip a card over. Yellow 7. Okay, now try to find the other Yellow 7. And she gets to flip over another card. If it's not the right one, I let her know that was a really good try. Now let's flip the cards over, and try it again. If she gets it right, I congratulate her, and she gets so excited. This way, she can play a simple game that also helps her work on her memory skills. So she can remember where certain cards were, and match them up. When she does well with six cards, I bump it up to eight cards. Then ten cards. It's simple, but fun for the smaller kids that may lose interest in actually playing UNO. And she still gets to have fun with the rest of us. There are no negatives about this set. The only thing that could have possibly been improved, is to have made the tin a tiny bit more travel-friendly. The two stacks of cards are held in plastic, inside of the tin. But it seems like they could have simply made the tin much smaller, and still fit the cards in. Making it a bit easier to just stick in your pocket. That's not a dealbreaker, just thinking out loud. Otherwise, the quality of the cards and tin are both great. Look. It's ten bucks. That's it. People spend more than that on two iced coffees, or a drive-through at a fast food place. But those are things you only get to enjoy once. Whereas you could use these cards in this tin for well over a decade. Plus you can make it a family tradition, or have fun when friends come over. It's advertised as a kid's game. But truth be told, we played it more in our dorm's game room than I ever did as a child. UNO never gets old. Why put it off? Add it to your shopping cart. You've got the ten bucks to spare, right now. Check out. It will show up at your home in as soon as a day, if you have Prime free shipping. And you can take that ten dollars, and turn it into million dollar memories with your family. But you can't do that, if you don't order it. So buy a set today, you'll be thankful you did.;Bring Back the Magic of Family Game Nights;real;real;B07P6MZPK3;75;Toys & Games;Mattel Games UNO Card Game for Family Night, Travel Game & Gift for Kids in a Collectible Storage Tin for 2-10 Players [Amazon Exclusive];61434;4.8;10;2023-04-29 08:47:54.267

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d3c;R1KDTQAPZRPNPN;;2023-01-16;TRUE;B00000IV35;5.0;Five Crowns is a super fun five-suited rummy-style card game. I think it involves equal parts of strategy and luck so it's fun for everyone. I had never heard of it until we played it at my brother's house and we were hooked and ended up ordering it on Amazon as soon as we got home. We play whenever we have company and my husband and I even play it occasionally since two people can still play it. It's not quite as fun with two, but it can be done. One thing I like is that things can change so quickly . . . if you're losing, a hand can bring you back to the winning side. There are 11 hands played, starting with 3 cards per player and 3s are wild. Then it increases by one card each round ending with 13 cards per player and Kings are wild. Jokers are always wild. This is a very nice length of time to complete a game for those who don't want to play all night. But if you do want to play another game, that's always an option. We usually just keep score on a piece of paper but you can print score sheets off the internet if you'd like.

So here are the positives: 1. Beautiful art work. 2. Big puzzle with big pieces. Very necessary for little hands. 3. Just at the right level of complexity for a 3 to 4 year old. BONUS: Made in India Now here are some possible improvements: 1. Some of the pieces came warped (bent). It's not possible to lay them flat on the ground. A child may sometimes not realize that the piece actually fits in a particular location because the crooked piece might not settle easily in the correct spot. 2. The pieces could have been sturdier. 3. For some reason the large image on the box is a crop of the image the full puzzle forms. It's the tiny image on the box that gives the full picture (no pun intended). 4. Including a poster with all the dinos labeled would have helped parents of inquisitive kids. Overall a pretty good set.

I used roughly half a sheet and then rounded the edges, cut a penny size hole toward the top and they worked fairly well. I would note that several of them did curl onto each other in the oven so we had to re-do those ornaments, which was a bummer. I don't know if it's because of the size or the way my oven heats (we used a large toaster oven). When shrunk, the finished product is remarkably clear. Sharpies were our coloring implement of choice which also left for some transparent designs. My 4 year old son had a blast with these and loved to watch them shrink.

The only problem is in the 80 color pack I bought, 1/3 of the colors don't even take to the shrink disks ""paper"", and the ones that do just kind of puddle on top which makes it hard to use.

Figured it would be a solid choice considering it‚Äôs the original brand name. Though results were just okay. Googled how much Shrinky Dink sheets shrink. Most answers said 1/3 size. I found it was closer to 41-45% of original size. Thickness was about 1/16‚Äù. The curling issue that several reviews mention isn‚Äôt a product issue. Place between two sheets of foil. Lightly crease the edges of the foil together so it stays closed while baking. This will prevent it from curling and sticking to itself. However, these sheets are not as uniform when shrinking. (see photo) These were cut using circle paper punches. As you can see there is distortion in most of the pieces. Not the end of the world. But also not what I was expecting. Don‚Äôt regret this purchase. And would buy again for some rainy day entertainment with the kids. But will stick with Grafix shrink plastic for art projects.;Works in a pinch.

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d4a;R1XIBG5DWINGR;;2023-02-22;TRUE;B0B94T2LMY;4.0;"I was pleasantly surprised to see that the children's toy that I, a woman in my late 30's decided to spend $20 on was not one of the lame milkshakes because let's be real, that would have pissed me off. I had already spent $10 on one of the less desirable coffee shop (or whatever the drink series is called) balls only to discover that there were only 2 steps involved and that the whipped cream came pre-made and didn't fit the cup unless I carved out a chunk to accommodate the straw. So unwrapping my strawberry cheesecake was a delight. I allows myself to indulge my infantile regression as I carefully opened all the little bags by cutting along the dotted lines instead of just using my teeth to rip them apart as I had done before. Imagine my thrill when I found that I had been blessed with a tiny fruit container for the disappointingly unrealistic fruit slices and two whole fake (like; wow they didn't even try) strawberries. I set to work carefully following each instruction, wielding the tiny useless tweezers as I began to construct a tiny model of a strawberry cheesecake. It was about 10 seconds in that I realized that this may be trickier than I had expected. As a hobby miniaturist I still felt confident that I could complete the kit in a way that met or perhaps exceeded the quality of the small picture on the little ""recipe sheet"" that contained no helpful hints but only crude drawings that seemed to indicate that I only had to squeeze out the pink glaze and arrange the slices and whole fruit in a simple pattern. In my hubris I forgot basic physics and failed to account for the fact that placing the strawberry decorations would displace some of the liquid glaze and before I could say ""my life is in shambles"" I had three spots where the glaze was simply dumping down the walls of the cheesecake and saturating the paper doily upon which the monstrosity now rested. No matter. Resin art is not new to me. I set about using isopropyl alcohol to carefully remove areas of excessive spillage. Alas it was for naught. I had lost my nerve. My sense of identity was shattering into dust as I saw that I had slightly tilted the model in my clean up attempt and how I had glaze running everywhere. The alcohol swab cleanup has become futile and I screamed internally that I should have just gone to law school like my parents said but we cannot change the course of fate. I desperately attempted to rearrange the strawberries which had floated into a pattern that made a mockery of traditional cheesecake arts. This also worsened the glaze tsunami. I took a break to meditate on the Buddhist concept of being crappy at making tiny models of cheesecake. It didn't help. I returned to the scene of the crime with little hope and attempted to salvage this Frankenstein's monster that society would surely reject. Finally I accepted defeat and withdrew my UV flashlight that I use to remind myself that no hotel is truly clean and watched with detachment as the horror solidified. I now lay sprawled across the hardwood floor of my crappy apartment, trying to convince myself that this is the wabi sabi of life to no avail. I now have this trophy to remind me to stay humble and stop spending money on these stupid kits, which I surmise were never intended for children. Rather these orbs are the product of some dark minds who send them forth into the world for fools like me to be laid low by the fact that we humans are weak, fragile and proud creatures and it is this set of fatal flaws that will ultimately be our undoing.";Waited for over a month only to choke on the execution;real;real;B0B94T2LMY;92;Toys & Games;MGA's Miniverse Make It Mini Food Diner Series 1 Minis, Blind Packaging, DIY, Resin Play, Collectors, 8+;389;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:50:18.698

The one I ordered took 4 weeks to arrive, and I learned I could just easily pick up at local stores. I highly recommend this item, your inner child will thank you! Check out some YouTube videos if you need to be convinced (such as NerdECrafter). I used a UV light that I have at home to cure the resin, which is very convenient. There are two different mystery balls- the Diner Series (this one) and the Cafe Series. In general the Diner Series has more steps to assemble. I would NOT recommend for small children, they shouldn't work with the resin, and it would likely be very frustrating placing the itsy bitsy pieces just right with the tongs. But, you can assemble them, then repackage in the ball for them to open as a surprise. If you cut the bags open correctly they look like grocery bags, and there are generally a few extra fruit pieces, etc. to keep the little containers as toys too, so would still be a delight for younger kids to receive after assembly.;Easier to buy locally;real;real;B0B94T2LMY;92;Toys & Games;MGA's Miniverse Make It Mini Food Diner Series 1 Minis, Blind Packaging, DIY, Resin Play, Collectors, 8+;389;4.6;10;2023-04-29 08:50:18.698

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d4c;RVGFVGEBX8ZHG;;2022-08-09;TRUE;B083W788TN;4.0;"This float is absolutely amazing. The safety harness ensures the baby stays nice and secure, and the float itself has equal floats all around to avoid any tip overs! Another great feature is the removable sun visor that covers the float, to ensure the baby isn‚Äôt exposed to the direct sun. This float allow for the baby‚Äôs legs to dangle in the water while securely sitting in the float. The front part where the baby‚Äôs face is, is inflated a bit more to ensure water doesn‚Äôt splash up in his or her face. It‚Äôs a great float that allows for plenty of water exposure; baby can kick in the water and splash, but enough safety features so baby is safe while in it. This float is also reversible. Meaning, you can place the baby face front, or turn the baby facing back so the baby can experience kicking in a frontwards direction or an a backwards direction. The one slight critique I do have is that it is not the easiest device to get the baby into. However once the baby is in the float, and then is in the water, all of the hassle of getting the baby into the float is forgotten. I love that this float comes with its own pump! It‚Äôs easy to inflate and easy to deflate. The removable sunscreen top is very easy to put on or off. I highly recommend this float. The baby will absolutely enjoy it and if this is one of the first times you are exposing your baby to the water, it‚Äôs a great way to do it.";Awesome float!;real;real;B083W788TN;94;Toys & Games;LAYCOL Baby Swimming Float Inflatable Baby Pool Float Ring Newest with Sun Protection Canopy,add Tail no flip Over for Age of 3-36 Months;14999;4.4;10;2023-04-29 08:50:35.465

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d4f;R19K91K7JQZ5JY;;2023-03-28;TRUE;B000YDDF6O;5.0;I recently purchased the Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes Musical Toy for my 3-month-old baby and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed! Not only is this toy visually appealing with its bright colors and adorable design, but it is also incredibly entertaining for my little one. As soon as I turned on the music, my baby's face lit up with pure joy and excitement. The tunes are catchy and fun, and the volume is just loud enough to grab her attention without being overwhelming. Plus, the music selection is diverse enough to keep both baby and parent entertained. What's even better is that this toy is designed to be portable and easy to take on the go. It's the perfect size for small hands to grasp, and the attached handle makes it easy to clip onto a diaper bag or stroller. It's been a lifesaver on car rides and trips to the grocery store - my baby is easily distracted by the music and is content for long periods of time. But the best part about this toy? It's just downright funny. I never thought I'd find myself laughing at a musical toy for babies, but the look on my baby's face when she's holding it and dancing along to the music is just too hilarious. And watching her attempt to sing along with the melodies is priceless. Overall, I highly recommend the Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes Musical Toy for any parent with a young baby. It's entertaining, portable, and best of all - funny! This toy gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me. The Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes Musical Toy is a popular toy for babies aged 3 months and up. Here are some useful tips and tricks to help your baby enjoy this toy: 1. Introduce the toy gradually: Start by playing the toy's music softly and from a distance. Let your baby get used to the sound before bringing the toy closer or increasing the volume. 2. Use the toy to encourage movement: Encourage your baby to reach for the toy and grasp it. You can also place the toy in front of your baby during tummy time to encourage them to lift their head and strengthen their neck muscles. 3. Sing along with the music: Singing along with the toy's music can help your baby develop their language skills and also make the playtime more interactive. 4. Use the toy to distract during diaper changes: The toy's music can be a great distraction during diaper changes, making the process less stressful for both you and your baby. 5. Take the toy with you on-the-go: The toy's compact size and easy-to-grasp handle make it a great on-the-go toy. You can attach it to your baby's stroller or car seat for entertainment during travel. 6. Use the toy for sensory play: The toy's bright colors and different textures can be used to stimulate your baby's senses. Encourage your baby to touch and explore the toy. 7. Clean the toy regularly: To ensure the toy stays hygienic, clean it regularly with a damp cloth or baby wipe. Avoid using harsh chemicals or submerging the toy in water.;A Funny and Entertaining Musical Toy for Your Little One;real;real;B000YDDF6O;97;Toys & Games;Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes Musical Toy, Ages 3 months +;50094;4.8;10;2023-04-29 08:51:00.642

644cb12cedd6fb90e1883d51;R6ODU9MBEME3M;;2023-01-19;TRUE;B08PS2F9RD;4.0;I read some reviews, and it seems people here had no understanding of what a deck is. All decks are made to play the game, and include about 1/3 trainer cards, 1/3 energy cards, and 1/3 pokemon, and often have up to 4 copies of most cards. That is what these decks have. These decks are fire/lightning and dark/psychic. They have some strategies within them - there is an insert with the decks that points out these strategies and suggests some cards you could add to them. It includes some extra tainer cards so you can switch out some. These are ready to battle, are reasonably balanced against each other, and include the fun plastic coins, boxes for each deck (that don't fit them if you use card protectors), and damage counters. If you are looking to buy two decks to instantly play the game, this is for you. Rayquaza deck also has Lanturn, Volcarona, Thundurus, Manectric, Simisear, and their pre-evolutions, Noivern deck includes Lugia, Xatu, Crobat, and Alcremerie. The only V card or foil card is the Noivern and Rayquaza (and two of the same foil trainer in the extras). These decks would not hold up well in a competition (I would imagine those have a lot more V cards and bigger strategies), but are fun for casual play.;Two reasonable decks;real;real;B08PS2F9RD;99;Toys & Games;Pokemon TCG: Shining Fates Elite Trainer Box;42559;4.5;10;2023-04-29 08:51:17.530
